Focus consultation : Discussions focused policies tackle macroeconomic imbalances promoting financial stability , economic diversification , growth . Key policy recommendations : Target overall fiscal deficit 2017 less 2 percent GDP , consistent improvement non-oil primary fiscal balance 1 percent GDP . Over medium term , target improvement non-oil primary fiscal balance 1 percent GDP annually consistent placing debt clearly declining path . This could achieved mobilizing additional non-oil taxes , reducing current spending increasing public investment improving efficiency . Adopt improved medium-term fiscal framework ( MTFF ) , focusing spending rules well-designed fiscal stabilization fund reduce spending pro-cyclicality . Move flexible managed exchange rate regime urgently address significant imbalances foreign exchange market , develop clear timetable removal exchange restrictions multiple currency practices . Adopt reserve money target consistent inflation objective . Increase financial sector resilience strengthening bank supervision , resolution AML/CFT frameworks , closing recapitalizing weaker banks . Promote economic diversification improving business environment , strengthening role private sector rebuilding infrastructure .\n"
