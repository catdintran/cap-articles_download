Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, and a commitment to diversify its markets and products have allowed Uruguay to show resilience in the face of sharp recessions in its large neighbors. Nevertheless, economic growth slowed down in 2015 and 2016 while inflation remains above target. In 2017, an improving regional environment is expected to contribute to a modest further recovery, while inflation should slowly converge towards the target range. Given rising debt and high inflation, the room for more expansionary fiscal or monetary policy is limited.\n",

      "\n",
      " The fiscal consolidation package for 2017 will support the downward trajectory of net debt and underpin Uruguay's hard-won credibility with international investors. The package should be implemented in a manner that supports the nascent recovery, including by allowing automatic stabilizers to work and by supporting infrastructure investment.\n",
      "\n",
      " Over the medium term, stronger fiscal anchors could enhance the credibility of public finances, expanding the scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy.\n",
      "\n",
      " Tight monetary conditions are important to support the disinflation effort. High dollarization currently saps monetary policy transmission, and de-dollarization will require progress in reducing inflation and deepening domestic currency capital markets. Steps to reduce wage indexation further could bolster the disinflation process.\n",

      "\n",
      "Past advice. In recent Article IV consultations, there has been broad agreement between the authorities and Fund staff on the macroeconomic policy objectives. The authorities have sought to tackle inflation by reducing wage-price inertia in line with staff advice, and have generally maintained a tight monetary policy stance. The fiscal consolidation package follows long-standing staff advice to reverse the rise in public debt over the medium term. Broadly in line with staff recommendations on the importance of exchange rate flexibility, the authorities have allowed the exchange rate to adjust, albeit with some interventions to smooth movements in both directions.\n",
