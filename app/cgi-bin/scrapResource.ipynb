      "['A', 'Agency costs', \"\\n     These can arise when somebody (the principal) hires somebody else (the agent) to carry out a task and the interests of the agent conflict with the interests of the principal. An example of such principal-agent problems comes from the relationship between the shareholders who own a public company and the managers who run it. The owners would like managers to run the firm in ways that maximise the value of their shares, whereas the managers' priority may be, say, to build a business empire through rapid expansion and  mergers and acquisitions , which may not increase their firm's share price.  \\t One way to reduce agency costs is for the principal to monitor what the agent does to make sure it is what he has been hired to do. But this can be costly, too. It may be impossible to define the agent's job in a way that can be monitored effectively. For instance, it is hard to know whether a manager who has expanded a firm through an acquisition that reduced its share price was pursuing his own empire-building interests or, say, was trying to maximise shareholder value but was unlucky.  \\t Another way to lower agency costs, especially when monitoring is too expensive or too difficult, is to make the interests of the agent more like those of the principal. For instance, an increasingly common solution to the agency costs arising from the separation of ownership and management of public companies is to pay managers partly with shares and share options in the company. This gives the managers a powerful incentive to act in the interests of the owners by maximising shareholder value. But even this is not a perfect solution. Some managers with lots of share options have engaged in accounting fraud in order to increase the value of those options long enough for them to cash some of them in, but to the detriment of their firm and its other shareholders. See, for example,  Enron . \"]\n",
      "['A', 'Altruism', '\\n     It is often alleged that altruism is inconsistent with economic rationality, which assumes that people behave selfishly. Certainly, much economic analysis is concerned with how individuals behave, and  homo economicus  ( economic man ) is usually assumed to act in his or her self-interest. However, self-interest does not necessarily mean selfish. Some economic models in the field of  behavioural economics  assume that self-interested individuals behave altruistically because they get some benefit, or  utility , from doing so. For instance, it may make them feel better about themselves, or be a useful insurance policy against social unrest, say. Some economic models go further and relax the traditional assumption of fully rational behaviour by simply assuming that people sometimes behave altruistically, even if this may be against their self-interest. Either way, there is much economic literature about charity,  international aid ,  public spending  and redistributive taxation. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Arbitrage pricing theory', '\\n     This is one of two influential economic theories of how assets are priced in the financial markets. The other is the  capital asset pricing model . The  arbitrage  pricing theory says that the price of a financial  asset  reflects a few key risk factors, such as the expected  rate of interest , and how the price of the asset changes relative to the price of a portfolio of assets. If the price of an asset happens to diverge from what the theory says it should be, arbitrage by investors should bring it back into line. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Asian crisis', '\\n     During 1997-98, many of the East Asian  tiger economies  suffered a severe finanical and economic crisis. This had big consequences for the global  financial markets , which had become increasingly exposed to the promise that Asia had seemed to offer. The crisis destroyed wealth on a massive scale and sent absolute poverty shooting up. In the banking system alone, corporate loans equivalent to around half of one year\\'s GDP went bad - a destruction of savings on a scale more usually associated with a full-scale war. The precise cause of the crisis remains a matter of debate. Fingers have been pointed at the  currency peg  adopted by some countries, and a reduction of  capital controls  in the years before the crisis. Some blamed economic  contagion . The crisis brought an end to a then widespread belief that there was a distinct \"Asian way\" of  capitalism  that might prove just as successful as capitalism in America or Europe. Instead, critics turned their fire on Asian cronyism, ill-disciplined banking and lack of  transparency . In the years following the crisis, most of the countries involved have introduced reforms designed to increase transparency and improve the health of the banking system, although some (such as South Korea) went much further than others (such as Indonesia).

      "['A', 'Amortisation', '\\n     The running down or payment of a loan by instalments. An example is a repayment mortgage on a house, which is amortised by making monthly payments that over a pre-agreed period of time cover the value of the loan plus  interest . With loans that are not amortised, the borrower pays only interest during the period of the loan and then repays the sum borrowed in full. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Advertising', '\\n     Many firms advertise their goods or services, but are they wasting economic resources? Some economists reckon that advertising merely manipulates consumer tastes and creates desires that would not otherwise exist. By increasing product differentiation and encouraging  brand  loyalty advertising may make consumers less price sensitive, moving the market further from  perfect competition  towards imperfect competition (see  monopolistic competition ) and increasing the ability of firms to charge more than marginal cost. Heavy spending on advertising may also create a barrier to entry, as a firm entering the market would have to spend a lot on advertising too. \\t However, some economists argue that advertising is economically valuable because it increases the flow of information in the economy and reduces the asymmetric information between the seller and the consumer. This intensifies competition, as consumers can be made aware quickly when there is a better deal on offer. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Average', '\\n     A number that is calculated to summarise a group of numbers. The most commonly used average is the mean, the sum of the numbers divided by however many numbers there are in the group. The median is the middle value in a group of numbers ranked in order of size. The mode is the number that occurs most often in a group of numbers. Take the following group of numbers: 1, 2, 2, 9, 12, 13, 17  The mean is 56/7=8,  The median is 9,  The mode is 2 ']\n",

      "['A', 'Antitrust', '\\n     government  policy for dealing with  monopoly . Antitrust laws aim to stop abuses of market power by big companies and, sometimes, to prevent corporate  mergers and acquisitions  that would create or strengthen a monopolist. There have been big differences in antitrust policies both among countries and within the same country over time. This has reflected different ideas about what constitutes a monopoly and, where there is one, what sorts of behaviour are abusive. \\t In the United States, monopoly policy has been built on the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. This prohibited contracts or conspiracies to restrain trade or, in the words of a later act, to monopolise commerce. In the early 20th century this law was used to reduce the economic power wielded by so-called \"robber barons\", such as JP Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, who dominated much of American industry through huge trusts that controlled companies\\' voting shares. Du Pont chemicals, the railroad companies and Rockefeller\\'s Standard Oil, among others, were broken up. In the 1970s the Sherman Act was turned (ultimately without success) against IBM, and in 1982 it secured the break-up of AT&T\\'s nationwide telecoms monopoly. \\t In the 1980s a more  laissez-faire  approach was adopted, underpinned by economic theories from the  chicago school . These theories said that the only justification for antitrust intervention should be that a lack of competition harmed consumers, and not that a firm had become, in some ill-defined sense, too big. Some monopolistic activities previously targeted by antitrust authorities, such as predatory pricing and exclusive marketing agreements, were much less harmful to consumers than had been thought in the past. They also criticised the traditional method of identifying a monopoly, which was based on looking at what percentage of a market was served by the biggest firm or firms, using a measure known as the  herfindahl-hirschman index . Instead, they argued that even a market dominated by one firm need not be a matter of antitrust concern, provided it was a contestable market.  \\t In the 1990s American antitrust policy became somewhat more interventionist. A high-profile lawsuit was launched against Microsoft in 1998. The giant software company was found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour, which was said to slow the pace of innovation. However, fears that the firm would be broken up, signalling a far more interventionalist American antitrust policy, proved misplaced. The firm was not severely punished. \\t In the UK, antitrust policy was long judged according to what policymakers decided was in the public interest. At times this approach was comparatively permissive of mergers and acquisitions; at others it was less so. However, in the mid-1980s the UK followed the American lead in basing antitrust policy on whether changes in competition harmed consumers. Within the rest of the  european union  several big countries pursued policies of building up national champions, allowing chosen firms to enjoy some monopoly power at home which could be used to make them more effective competitors abroad. However, during the 1990s the European Commission became increasingly active in antitrust policy, mostly seeking to promote competition within the EU.  \\t In 2000, the EU controversially blocked a merger between two American firms, GE and Honeywell; the deal had already been approved by America\\'s antitrust regulators. The controversy highlighted an important issue. As  globalisation  increases, the relevant market for judging whether market power exists or is being abused will increasingly cover far more territory than any one single economy. Indeed, there may be a need to establish a global antitrust watchdog, perhaps under the auspices of the  world trade organisation . ']\n",

      "['A', 'Autarky', '\\n     The idea that a country should be self-sufficient and not take part in international trade. The experience of countries that have pursued this Utopian ideal by substituting domestic production for imports is an unhappy one. No country has been able to produce the full range of goods demanded by its population at competitive prices. Indeed, those that have tried to do so have condemned themselves to inefficiency and comparative poverty, compared with countries that engage in international trade. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Agriculture', \"\\n     Farming around the world continues to become more productive while generally accounting for a smaller share of employment and  national income , although in some poor countries it remains the sector on which the country and its people depend. Farming, forestry and fishing in 1913 accounted for 28% of employment in the United States, 41% in France and 60% in Japan, but only 12% in the UK. Now the proportion of the workforce employed in such activities has dropped below 6% in these and most other industrialised countries. \\t The total value of international trade in agriculture has risen steadily. But the global agriculture market remains severely distorted by trade barriers and government subsidy, such as the  european union 's Common  agricultural policy . \"]\n",
      "['A', 'Agricultural policy', \"\\n     Countries often provide support for their farmers using trade barriers and  subsidy  because, for example: \\t *domestic agriculture, even if it is inefficient by world standards, can be an insurance policy in case it becomes difficult (as it does, for example, in wartime) to buy agricultural produce from abroad; \\t *farmers groups have proved adept at lobbying; \\t *politicians have sought to slow the depopulation of rural areas; \\t *agricultural prices can be volatile, as a result of unpredictable weather, among other things; and \\t *financial support can provide a safety net in unexpectedly severe market conditions. \\t Broadly speaking, governments have tried two methods of subsidising agriculture. The first, used in the United States during the 1930s and in the UK before it joined the European Union, is to top up farmers' incomes if they fall below a level deemed acceptable. Farmers may be required to set aside some of their land in return for this support. The second is to guarantee a minimum level of farm prices by buying up surplus supply and storing or destroying it if prices would otherwise fall below the guaranteed levels. This was the approach adopted by the EU when it set up its Common Agricultural Policy. To keep down the direct cost of this subsidy the EU used trade barriers, including import levies, to minimise competition to EU farmers from produce available more cheaply on world agriculture markets. Recent American farm-support policy has combined income top-ups and some guaranteed prices. \\t As most governments have become more committed to international trade, such agricultural policies have come under increasing attack, although the free trade rhetoric has often run far ahead of genuine reform. In 2003, rich countries together spent over $300 billion a year supporting their farmers, more than six times what they spent on foreign  AID . Finding a way to end agricultural support had become by far the biggest remaining challenge for those trying to negotiate global  free trade . \"]\n",
      "['A', 'Austrian economics', '\\n     A brand of neo-classical economics established in Vienna during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It was strongly opposed to Marxism and, more broadly, to the use of economic theories to justify  government  intervention in the economy. Prominent members included  Friedrich hayek ,  Joseph schumpeter  and Ludwig von Mises. It gave birth to the definition of economics as the science of studying human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses. Austrian economic thinking was characterised by attributing all economic activity, including the behaviour of apparently impersonal institutions, to the wishes and actions of individuals. It did this by examining choices in terms of their  opportunity cost  (that is, what is the next best use of resources to that which is being considered?) and by analysing the impact of timing on decision making. \\t Hayek correctly predicted the failure of Soviet-style central planning. His ideas are said to have inspired many of the free-market reforms carried out during the 1980s in the United States under Ronald Reagan and in the UK under Margaret Thatcher. Schumpeter developed a theory of innovation and economic change characterised by the phrase creative destruction. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Arbitrage', '\\n     Buying an  asset  in one market and simultaneously selling an identical asset in another market at a higher price. Sometimes these will be identical assets in different markets, for instance, shares in a company listed on both the London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Often the assets being arbitraged will be identical in a more complicated way, for example, they will be different sorts of financial  securities  that are each exposed to identical  risks . \\t Some kinds of arbitrage are completely risk-free-this is pure arbitrage. For instance, if  EUROS  are available more cheaply in dollars in London than in New York, arbitrageurs (also known as arbs) can make a risk-free  PROFIT  by buying euros in London and selling an identical amount of them in New York. Opportunities for pure arbitrage have become rare in recent years, partly because of the  GLOBALISATION  of  FINANCIAL MARKETS . Today, a lot of so called arbitrage, much of it done by  hedge funds , involves assets that have some similarities but are not identical. This is not pure arbitrage and can be far from risk free.

      "['A', 'Animal spirits', '\\n     The colourful name that  keynes  gave to one of the essential ingredients of economic prosperity: confidence. According to Keynes, animal spirits are a particular sort of confidence, \"naive optimism\". He meant this in the sense that, for entrepreneurs in particular, \"the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, as experience undoubtedly tells us and them, is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of death\". Where these animal spirits come from is something of a mystery. Certainly, attempts by politicians and others to talk up confidence by making optimistic noises about economic prospects have rarely done much good. ']\n",

Such asymmetric information can make it difficult for the two people to do business together, which is why economists, especially those practising  game theory , are interested in it. Transactions involving asymmetric (or private) information are everywhere. A government selling broadcasting licences does not know what buyers are prepared to pay for them; a lender does not know how likely a borrower is to repay; a used-car seller knows more about the quality of the car being sold than do potential buyers. This kind of asymmetry can distort people's incentives and result in significant inefficiencies. \"]\n",
      "['A', 'Adverse selection', '\\n     When you do business with people you would be better off avoiding. This is one of two main sorts of  market failure  often associated with insurance. The other is  moral hazard . Adverse selection can be a problem when there is  asymmetric information  between the seller of  insurance  and the buyer; in particular, insurance will often not be profitable when buyers have better information about their risk of claiming than does the seller. Ideally, insurance premiums should be set according to the risk of a randomly selected person in the insured slice of the population (55-year-old male smokers, say). In practice, this means the  average   risk  of that group. When there is adverse selection, people who know they have a higher risk of claiming than the average of the group will buy the insurance, whereas those who have a below-average risk may decide it is too expensive to be worth buying. In this case, premiums set according to the average risk will not be sufficient to cover the claims that eventually arise, because among the people who have bought the policy more will have above-average risk than below-average risk. Putting up the premium will not solve this problem, for as the premium rises the insurance policy will become unattractive to more of the people who know they have a lower risk of claiming. One way to reduce adverse selection is to make the purchase of insurance compulsory, so that those for whom insurance priced for average risk is unattractive are not able to opt out. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Asymmetric shock', '\\n     When something unexpected happens that affects one economy (or part of an economy) more than the rest. This can create big problems for policymakers if they are trying to set a  macroeconomic policy  that works for both the area affected by the  shock  and the unaffected area. For instance, some economic areas may be oil exporters and thus highly dependent on the  price  of oil, but other areas are not. If the oil price plunges, the oil-dependent area would benefit from policies designed to boost demand that might be unsuited to the needs of the rest of the economy.

If one person, firm or country can produce more of something with the same amount of effort and resources, they have an absolute advantage over other producers. Being the best at something does not mean that doing that thing is the best way to use your scarce economic resources.

Both absolute and comparative advantage may change significantly over time. ']\n",
      "['A', 'Auctions', \"\\n     Going, going, gone. Holding an auction can be an extremely efficient way for a seller to set the price of its products, especially if it does not have much  information  about how much people may be willing to pay for them. Auctions fascinate economists, especially those who specialise in  game theory . They have long been a feature of the sale of art and antiques in the rooms of firms such as Sotheby's and Christie's. But in recent years they have played a growing role in other parts of the economy, ranging from the allocation of  government -controlled broadcasting bandwidth to the awarding of work to subcontractors by governments and big firms using competitive tendering, and even more recently the sale of goods over the Internet. \\t An English auction is the most familiar. Bidders compete to offer higher prices and drop out until only one remains. In a Dutch auction, the auctioneer calls out a high price then keeps lowering it until there is a buyer. There are various forms of sealed bid auctions. In a first price sealed bid, each buyer submits a price in a sealed envelope and all bids are opened simultaneously, with the highest offer winning. In a second (or third, fourth, and so on) price sealed bid, the highest bidder wins but pays only the second (third, fourth) highest price bid.  \\t An English or Dutch auction will work well for a seller if there is more than one serious bidder, as  competition  will ensure that the price is set at the level at which it is not worth more to any other bidder but the winner. Indeed, in a competitive auction the successful bidder may end up offering more than what is being auctioned is actually worth. This is known as the winner's curse.  \\t Which method will generate the best price for the seller depends on how many bidders take part and how well informed they are. Unfortunately for the seller, this information is not always available before the auction takes place. \"]\n",
      "['B', 'Bubble', '\\n     When the  price  of an  asset  rises far higher than can be explained by fundamentals, such as the income likely to derive from holding the asset.  The Chicago Tribune  of April 13th 1890, writing about the then mania in real-estate prices, described \"men who bought property at prices they knew perfectly well were fictitious, but who were prepared to pay such prices simply because they knew that some still greater fool could be depended on to take the property off their hands and leave them with a profit\". Such behaviour is a feature of all bubbles. \\t Famous bubbles include tulip mania in Holland during the 17th century, when the prices of tulip bulbs reached unheard of levels, and the South Sea Bubble in Britain a century later, although there have been many others since, including the dotcom bubble in internet company  shares  that burst in 2000. Economists argue about whether bubbles are the result of irrational crowd behaviour (perhaps coupled with exploitation of the gullible masses by some savvy speculators) or, instead, are the result of rational decisions by people who have only limited information about the fundamental value of an asset and thus for whom it may be quite sensible to assume the market price is sound. Whatever their cause, bubbles do not last forever and often end not with a pop but with a crash. ']\n",

If bankrupts are punished too severely, would-be entrepreneurs may be discouraged from taking the financial risks needed to make the most of their ideas. However, letting off defaulting debtors too readily may discourage potential creditors because of  moral hazard .  America's bankruptcy code, in particular its Chapter 11 protection for  firms  from their creditors, is particularly friendly to troubled borrowers, allowing them to borrow more money and giving them time to work out their problems. Some other countries quickly close down a bankrupt firm, and try to repay its  debts  by selling off any  assets  it has. \"]\n",
      "['B', 'Black-Scholes', '\\n     A formula for pricing financial options. Its invention allowed a previously undreamed of precision in the pricing of options (which had hitherto been done using crude rules of thumb), and probably made possible the explosive  growth  in the markets for options and other  derivatives  that took place after the formula became widely used in the early 1970s. Myron Scholes and Robert Merton were awarded the  nobel prize for economics  for their part in devising the formula; their co-inventor, Fischer Black (1938-95), was ineligible, having died. ']\n",
      "['B', 'Big Mac index', '\\n     The Big Mac index was devised by Pam Woodall of  The Economist  in 1986, as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their \"correct\" level. It is based on one of the oldest concepts in international economics,  purchasing power parity  (PPP), the notion that a dollar, say, should buy the same amount in all countries. In the long run, argue ppp fans, currencies should move towards the  exchange rate , which equalises the  prices  of an identical basket of goods and  services  in each country. In this case, the basket is a McDonalds\\' Big Mac, which is produced in more than 100 countries. The Big Mac PPP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in the United States as elsewhere. Comparing actual exchange rates with PPP signals whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued. Some studies have found that the Big Mac index is often a better predictor of currency movements than more theoretically rigorous models. ']\n",
      "['B', 'Barriers to entry (or exit)', '\\n     How firms keep out  competition --an important source of  incumbent advantage . There are four main sorts of barriers.\\n *A firm may own a crucial resource, such as an oil well, or it may have an exclusive operating licence, for instance, to broadcast on a particular radio wavelength.\\n *A big firm with  economies of scale  may have a significant competitive advantage because it can produce a large  output  at lower costs than can a smaller potential rival.\\n *An incumbent firm may make it hard for a would-be entrant by incurring huge  sunk costs , spending lots of  money  on things such as  advertising , which any rival must match to compete effectively but which have no value if the attempt to compete should fail.\\n *Powerful firms can discourage entry by raising exit costs, for example, by making it an industry norm to hire workers on long-term contracts, which make firing an expensive process.

      "['B', 'Balanced budget', '\\n     When total public-sector spending equals total government income during the same period from taxes and charges for public services. Politicians in some countries, such as the United States, have argued that government should be required to run a balanced budget in order to have sound public finances. However, there is no economic reason why public borrowing need necessarily be bad. For instance, if the  debt  is used to invest in things that will increase the  growth  rate of the economy-- infrastructure , say, or education--it may be justified. It may also make more economic sense to try to balance the budget on average over an entire economic cycle, with public-sector deficits boosting the economy during  recession  and surpluses stopping it overheating during booms, than to balance it every year.

      "['B', 'Barter', '\\n     Paying for goods or  services  with other goods or services, instead of with  money . It is often popular when the quality of money is low or uncertain, perhaps because of high  inflation  or counterfeiting, or when people are  asset -rich but cash-poor, or when  taxation  or extortion by criminals is high.

      "['B', 'Bank', '\\n     Starting out as places that would guard your  money , banks became the main source of  credit creation . Increasingly, however, borrowers are turning to the  financial markets  and to non-savings institutions, such as credit-card companies and consumer-finance firms, when they need a loan. This is reducing the profitability of traditional bank lending and has led many banks to enter new areas of business, such as selling  insurance  policies and mutual funds. Increasingly, too, traditional banks are selling off parcels of their loans in the financial markets by a process called  securitisation . \\t What the most efficient split is between bank lending and other sorts of lending is debatable. Economists argue endlessly about whether an economy such as the United States, in which firms rely more heavily on the  equity  and  debt  markets than on banks to fund their  investment , is better than one such as, say, Germany, in which banks have traditionally been the main source of corporate finance.  \\t Banks come in many different forms. Commercial banks, also known as retail banks, cater directly for the general public and lend to (mostly small and medium-sized) firms. In the past, they did so largely through a network of bank branches, although increasingly these are giving way to atm machines, the telephone and the Internet. Wholesale banks largely transact with other banks and financial institutions. Investment banks, also known as merchant banks, concentrate on raising money for companies from private investors or in the financial markets, by finding buyers for their equity and corporate  bonds . Universal banks do most or all of the above including, through bancassurance, selling insurance. These banks have long been a feature of continental European economies. However, in the United States financial laws such as the Glass-Steagall Act have separated different forms of banking from each other and kept banks out of the insurance business. These laws were abolished in 1999, although during the preceding couple of decades regulators effectively dismantled them by changing the way they were applied. Even so, because of these and other laws, which for many years stopped banks from operating across state borders, the United States has far more lending institutions than other countries. In 2003 there were over four lending institutions per 100,000 people in the United States, compared with fewer than one per 100,000 in the UK and France. ']\n",

Such transactions do not normally show up in the figures for GDP, so the black economy may mean that a country is much richer than the official data suggest. In the United States and the UK, the black economy adds an estimated 5-10% to GDP; in Italy, it may add 30%. As for Russia, in the late 1990s estimates of the black economy ranged as high as 50% of  GDP . ']\n",

If a company\\'s shares have a beta of 0.8 it implies that on average the share price will change by 0.8% if there is a 1% change in the market. There is a long-running debate about whether a beta calculated from a security\\'s past relationship with the market actually predicts how that relationship will behave in future, leading some doubting economists to claim that beta is \"dead\".

A bond is an  interest -bearing  security  issued by governments, companies and some other organisations. Bonds are an alternative way for the issuer to raise capital to selling shares or taking out a  bank  loan. Like shares in listed companies, once they have been issued bonds may be traded on the open market. A bond\\'s  yield  is the  interest rate  (or coupon) paid on the bond divided by the bond\\'s market  price . Bonds are regarded as a lower  risk   investment .  government  bonds, in particular, are highly unlikely to miss their promised payments.

The budgeting process differs enormously from one country to another. In the United States, for example, the president proposes a budget in February for the fiscal year starting the following October, but this has to be approved by Congress. By the time a final decision has to be made, ideally, no later than September, there are often three competing versions: the president's latest proposal, one from the Senate and another from the House of Representatives. What finally emerges is the result of last-minute negotiations. Occasionally, delays in agreeing the budget have led to the temporary closure of some federal government offices. Contrast this with the UK, where most of what the  government  proposes is usually approved by parliament, and some changes take effect as soon as they are announced (subject to subsequent parliamentary vote). \"]\n",
      "['B', 'Behavioural economics', '\\n     A branch of  economics  that concentrates on explaining the economic decisions people make in practice, especially when these conflict with what conventional economic theory predicts they will do. Behaviourists try to augment or replace traditional ideas of economic rationality ( homo economicus ) with decision-making models borrowed from psychology. According to psychologists, people are disproportionately influenced by a fear of feeling regret and will often forgo benefits even to avoid only a small risk of feeling they have failed. They are also prone to cognitive dissonance, often holding on to a belief plainly at odds with new evidence, usually because the belief has been held and cherished for a long time. Then there is anchoring: people are often overly influenced by outside suggestion. People apparently also suffer from status quo bias: they are willing to take bigger gambles to maintain the status quo than they would be to acquire it in the first place. \\t Traditional  utility  theory assumes that people make individual decisions in the context of the big picture. But psychologists have found that they generally compartmentalise, often on superficial grounds. They then make choices about things in one particular mental compartment without taking account of the implications for things in other compartments. \\t There is lots of evidence that people are persistently and irrationally overconfident. They are also vulnerable to hindsight bias: once something happens they overestimate the extent to which they could have predicted it. Many of these traits are captured in  prospect theory , which is at the heart of much of behavioural economics. ']\n",

It was agreed that the  exchange rates  of IMF members would be pegged to the dollar, with a maximum variation of 1% either side of the agreed rate. Rates could be adjusted more sharply only if a country's  balance of payments  was in fundamental  disequilibrium . In August 1971 economic troubles and the cost of financing the Vietnam war led the American president, Richard Nixon, to devalue the dollar.

      "['B', 'Balance of payments', '\\n     The total of all the  money  coming into a country from abroad less all of the money going out of the country during the same period. This is usually broken down into the current account and the capital account. The current account includes: \\t * visible trade  (known as merchandise trade in the United States), which is the value of  exports  and  imports  of physical goods; \\t * invisible trade , which is receipts and payments for services, such as banking or advertising, and other intangible goods, such as copyrights, as well as cross-border  dividend  and  interest  payments; \\t *private transfers, such as money sent home by expatriate workers; \\t *official transfers, such as  international aid . \\t The capital account includes: \\t *long-term capital flows, such as money invested in foreign firms, and profits made by selling those investments and bringing the money home; \\t *short-term capital flows, such as money invested in foreign currencies by international speculators, and funds moved around the world for business purposes by multinational companies. These short-term flows can lead to sharp movements in  exchange rates , which bear little relation to what currencies should be worth judging by fundamental measures of value such as  purchasing power parity . \\t As bills must be paid, ultimately a country\\'s accounts must balance (although because real life is never that neat a balancing item is usually inserted to cover up the inconsistencies).  \\t \"Balance of payments crisis\" is a politically charged phrase. But a country can often sustain a current account deficit for many years without its economy suffering, because any deficit is likely to be tiny compared with the country\\'s  national income  and wealth. Indeed, if the deficit is due to firms importing technology and other capital goods from abroad, which will improve their  productivity , the economy may benefit. A deficit that has to be financed by the public sector may be more problematic, particularly if the public sector faces limits on how much it can raise taxes or borrow or has few financial reserves. For instance, when the Russian government failed to pay the interest on its foreign  debt  in August 1998 it found it impossible to borrow any more money in the international financial markets. Nor was it able to increase taxes in its collapsing economy or to find anybody within Russia willing to lend it money. That truly was a balance of payments crisis.  In the early years of the 21st century, economists started to worry that the United States would find itself in a balance of payments crisis. Its current account deficit grew to over 5% of its  GDP , making its economy increasingly reliant on foreign  credit . ']\n",
      "['B', 'Basel 1 and 2', '\\n     An attempt to reduce the number of bank failures by tying a bank\\'s  capital adequacy ratio  to the riskiness of the loans it makes. For instance, there is less chance of a loan to a  government  going bad than a loan to, say, an internet business, so the bank should not have to hold as much capital in reserve against the first loan as against the second. The first attempt to do this worldwide was by the Basel committee for international banking supervision in 1988. However, its system of judging the relative riskiness of different loans was crude. For instance, it penalised banks no more for making loans to a fly-by-night software company in Thailand than to Microsoft; no more for loans to South Korea, bailed out by the  IMF  in 1998, than to Switzerland. In 1998, \"Basel 2\" was proposed, using much more sophisticated risk classifications. However, controversy over these new classifications, and the cost to banks of administering the new approach, led to the introduction of Basel 2 being delayed until (at least) 2005. ']\n",
      "['B', 'Business cycle', '\\n     Boom and bust. The long-run pattern of economic  growth  and  recession . According to the Centre for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, between 1854 and 1945 the average expansion lasted 29 months and the average contraction 21 months. Since the second world war, however, expansions have lasted almost twice as long, an average of 50 months, and contractions have shortened to an average of only 11 months. Over the years, economists have produced numerous theories of why economic activity fluctuates so much, none of them particularly convincing. A Kitchin cycle supposedly lasted 39 months and was due to fluctuations in companies\\' inventories. The Juglar cycle would last 8-9 years as a result of changes in  investment  in plant and machinery. Then there was the 20-year Kuznets cycle, allegedly driven by house-building, and, perhaps the best-known theory of them all, the 50-year kondratieff wave. \\t hayek  tangled with  keynes  over what caused the business cycle, and won the  nobel prize for economics  for his theory that variations in an economy\\'s  output  depended on the sort of capital it had. Taking a quite different tack, in the late 1960s Arthur Okun, an economic adviser to presidents Kennedy and Johnson, proclaimed that the business cycle was \"obsolete\". A year later, the American economy was in recession. Again, in the late 1990s, some economists claimed that technological innovation and  globalisation  meant that the business cycle was a thing of the past. Alas, they were soon proved wrong. ']\n",

A symbol of America's corporate power, since most of the world's best-known brands, from Coca Cola to Nike, are American. That is the case against.  Many economists regard brands as a good thing, however. A brand provides a guarantee of reliability and quality. Consumer trust is the basis of all brand values. So companies that own the brands have an immense incentive to work to retain that trust. Brands have value only where consumers have choice. The arrival of foreign brands, and the emergence of domestic brands, in former communist and other poorer countries points to an increase in  competition  from which consumers gain. Because a strong brand often requires expensive  advertising  and good marketing, it can raise both  price  and  barriers to entry . But not to insurperable levels: brands fade as tastes change; if quality is not maintained, neither is the brand. \"]\n",

Commodities are often traded on commodity exchanges. On  AVERAGE , the  PRICE  of natural commodities has fallen steadily in  REAL TERMS  in defiance of some predictions that growing  CONSUMPTION  of non-renewables such as copper would force prices up. At times the oil price has risen sharply in real terms, most notably during the 1970s, but this was due not to the exhaustion of limited supplies but to rationing by the  OPEC   CARTEL , or war, or fear of it, particularly in the oil-rich Middle East.

A central bank sets short-term  INTEREST RATES  and oversees the health of the  FINANCIAL SYSTEM , including by acting as  LENDER OF LAST RESORT  to commercial banks that get into financial difficulties. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, was founded in 1913. The Bank of England, known affectionately as the 'Old Lady of Threadneedle Street', was established in 1694, 26\\xa0years after the creation of the world's first central bank in Sweden. With the birth of the  EURO  in 1999, the  MONETARY POLICY  powers of the central banks of 11\\xa0European countries were transferred to a new  EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK , based in Frankfurt.\\n During the 1990s there was a trend to make central banks independent from political intervention in their day-to-day operations and allow them to set interest rates. Independent central banks should be able to concentrate on the long-term needs of an economy, whereas political intervention may be guided by the short-term needs of the  GOVERNMENT . In theory, an independent central bank should reduce the risk of  INFLATION .  Some central banks are legally requried to set interest rates so as to hit an explicit  inflation target . Politicians are often tempted to exploit a possible short-term trade-off between inflation and  UNEMPLOYMENT , even though the long-term consequence of easing policy in this way is (most economists say) that the unemployment rate returns to what you started with and inflation is higher. An independent central bank, because it does not have to worry about persuading an electorate to vote for it, is more likely to act in the best long-run interests of the economy. \"]\n",

Production processes that use a lot of capital relative to labour are  CAPITAL INTENSIVE ; those that use comparatively little capital are  LABOUR INTENSIVE . Capital takes different forms.  A firm's  ASSETS  are known as its capital, which may include fixed capital (machinery, buildings, and so on) and working capital (stocks of raw materials and part-finished products, as well as money, that are used up quickly in the production process). Financial capital includes money,  BONDS  and  SHARES .

      "['C', 'Catch-up effect', \"\\n     In any period, the economies of countries that start off poor generally grow faster than the economies of countries that start off rich. As a result, the  NATIONAL INCOME  of poor countries usually catches up with the national income of rich countries. New technology may even allow  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES   to leap-frog over industrialised countries with older technology. This, at least, is the traditional economic theory. In recent years, there has been considerable debate about the extent and speed of convergence in reality.\\n One reason to expect catch-up is that workers in poor countries have little access to  CAPITAL , so their  PRODUCTIVITY  is often low. Increasing the amount of capital at their disposal by only a small amount can produce huge gains in productivity. Countries with lots of capital, and as a result higher levels of productivity, would enjoy a much smaller gain from a similar increase in capital. This is one possible explanation for the much faster  GROWTH  of Japan and Germany, compared with the United States and the UK, after the second world war and the faster growth of several Asian 'tigers', compared with developed countries, during the 1980s and most of the 1990s. \"]\n",

Examples include limits on foreign  INVESTMENT  in a country's  FINANCIAL MARKETS , on direct investment by foreigners in businesses or property, and on domestic residents' investments abroad. Until the 20th century capital controls were uncommon, but many countries then imposed them. Following the end of the second world war only Switzerland, Canada and the United States adopted open capital regimes. Other rich countries maintained strict controls and many made them tougher during the 1960s and 1970s. This changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when most developed countries scrapped their capital controls.\\n The pattern was more mixed in developing countries. Latin American countries imposed lots of them during the debt crisis of the 1980s then scrapped most of them from the late 1980s onwards. Asian countries began to loosen their widespread capital controls in the 1980s and did so more rapidly during the 1990s.\\n In developed countries, there were two main reasons why capital controls were lifted: free markets became more fashionable and financiers became adept at finding ways around the controls. Developing countries later discovered that foreign capital could play a part in financing domestic investment, from roads in Thailand  to telecoms systems in Mexico, and, furthermore, that financial capital often brought with it valuable  HUMAN CAPITAL . They also found that capital controls did not work and had unwanted side-effects. Latin America's controls in the 1980s failed to keep much money at home and also deterred foreign investment.\\n The Asian economic crisis and  CAPITAL FLIGHT  of the late 1990s revived interest in capital controls, as some Asian governments wondered whether lifting the controls had left them vulnerable to the whims of international speculators, whose money could flow out of a country as fast as it once flowed in. There was also discussion of a 'Tobin tax' on short-term capital movements, proposed by James  TOBIN , a winner of the  NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS . Even so, they mostly considered only limited controls on short-term capital movements, particularly movements out of a country, and did not reverse the broader 20-year-old process of global financial and economic  LIBERALISATION . \"]\n",

This is because  INNOVATION  often takes the form of what economists call creative destruction (see  SCHUMPETER ), in which a superior new product destroys the market for existing products.

It is particularly common when there is an  OLIGOPOLY . The aim of such collusion is to increase  PROFIT  by reducing  COMPETITION . Identifying and breaking up cartels is an important part of the competition policy overseen by  ANTITRUST  watchdogs in most countries, although proving the existence of a cartel is rarely easy, as firms are usually not so careless as to put agreements to collude on paper. The desire to form cartels is strong.

      "['C', 'Competitiveness', \"\\n     'Real economists don't talk about competitiveness,' said Paul Krugman, a much-respected contemporary economist. Real businessmen and real politicians talk about it all the time, however. Many  FIRMS  have undergone savage downsizing to remain competitive, and governments have set up numerous committees to examine how to sharpen their countries' economic performance.\\n Mr Krugman's objection was not to the use of the term competitiveness by companies, which often do have competitors that they must beat, but to applying it to countries. At best, it is a meaningless word when applied to national economies; at worst, it encourages  PROTECTIONISM . Countries, he claimed, do not compete in the same way as companies. When two companies compete, one's gain is the other's loss, whereas international trade, Mr Krugman argued, is not a  ZERO-SUM GAME : when two countries compete through trade they both win.\\n Yet measures of national competitiveness are not complete nonsense. A country's future prosperity depends on its  GROWTH  in  PRODUCTIVITY , which  GOVERNMENT  policies can influence. Countries do compete in that they choose policies to promote higher living standards. Even so, conceptual and measurement difficulties mean that the growing number of indices purporting to compare the competitiveness of different countries should probably be taken with a large pinch of salt. \"]\n",

      "['C', 'Concentration', '\\n     The tendency of a market to be dominated by a few big  FIRMS . A high degree of concentration may be evidence of  ANTITRUST  problems, if it reflects a lack of  COMPETITION . Traditionally, economists examined whether there was too much concentration using the  HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX , which is determined by adding the squares of the market shares of all firms involved. A low Herfindahl indicated many competitors and thus great difficulty in exercising  MARKET POWER ; a high Herfindahl, however, suggested a concentrated market in which  PRICE  rises are easier to sustain. More recently, antitrust authorities have placed less emphasis on concentration. One reason is that it is hard to define the market in which concentration should be measured. Instead, antitrust authorities have turned their attention to finding examples of firms earning excessive profits or holding back  INNOVATION , although this too raises tricky conceptual and practical questions.

      "['C', 'Capital asset pricing model', \"\\n     A method of valuing  ASSETS  and calculating the  COST OF CAPITAL  (for an alternative, see  ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY ). The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) has come to dominate modern finance.\\n The rationale of the CAPM can be simplified as follows. Investors can eliminate some sorts of  RISK , known as  RESIDUAL RISK  or alpha, by holding a diversified portfolio of assets (see  MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY ). These alpha risks are specific to an individual asset, for example, the risk that a company's managers will turn out to be no good. Some risks, such as that of a global  RECESSION , cannot be eliminated through diversification. So even a basket of all of the  SHARES  in a stockmarket will still be risky. People must be rewarded for investing in such a risky basket by earning returns on  AVERAGE  above those that they can get on safer assets, such as  TREASURY BILLS . Assuming investors diversify away alpha risks, how an investor values any particular asset should depend crucially on how much the asset's  PRICE  is affected by the risk of the market as a whole. The market's risk contribution is captured by a measure of relative volatility,  BETA , which \\xadindicates how much an asset's  price is expected to change when the overall market changes.\\n Safe investments have a beta close to zero: economists call these assets risk free. Riskier investments, such as a share, should earn a premium over the risk-free rate. How much is calculated by the average premium for all assets of that type, multiplied by the particular asset's beta.\\n But does the CAPM work? It all comes down to beta, which some economists have found of dubious use. They think the CAPM may be an elegant theory that is no good in practice. Yet it is probably the best and certainly the most widely used method for calculating the cost of capital. \"]\n",

      "['C', 'Comparative advantage', \"\\n     Paul Samuelson, one of the 20th century's greatest economists, once remarked that the principle of comparative advantage was the only big idea that  ECONOMICS  had produced that was both true and surprising. It is also one of the oldest theories in economics, usually ascribed to  DAVID RICARDO . The theory underpins the economic case for  FREE TRADE . But it is often misunderstood or misrepresented by opponents of free trade. It shows how countries can gain from trading with each other even if one of them is more efficient - it has an  ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE  - in every sort of economic activity. Comparative advantage is about identifying which activities a country (or firm or individual) is most efficient at doing.\\n To see how this theory works imagine two countries, Alpha and Omega. Each country has 1,000 workers and can make two goods, computers and cars. Alpha's economy is far more productive than Omega's. To make a car, Alpha needs  two workers, compared with Omega's four. To make a computer, Alpha uses 10 workers, compared with Omega's 100. If there is no trade, and in each country half the workers are in each industry, Alpha produces 250 cars and 50 computers and Omega produces 125 cars and 5 computers.\\n What if the two countries specialise? Although Alpha makes both cars and computers more efficiently than Omega (it has an absolute advantage), it has a bigger edge in computer making. So it now devotes most of its resources to that industry, employing 700 workers to make computers and only 300 to make cars. This raises computer output to 70 and cuts car production to 150. Omega switches entirely to cars, turning out 250.\\n World output of both goods has risen. Both countries can consume more of both if they trade, but at what  PRICE ? Neither will want to import what it could make more cheaply at home. So Alpha will want at least 5 cars per computer, and Omega will not give up more than 25 cars per computer. Suppose the terms of trade are fixed at 12 cars per computer and 120 cars are exchanged for 10 computers. Then Alpha ends up with 270 cars and 60 computers, and Omega with 130 cars and 10 computers. Both are better off than they would be if they did not trade.\\n This is true even though Alpha has an absolute advantage in making both computers and cars. The reason is that each country has a different comparative advantage. Alpha's edge is greater in computers than in cars. Omega, although a costlier producer in both industries, is a less expensive maker of cars. If each country specialises in products in which it has a comparative advantage, both will gain from trade.\\n In essence, the theory of comparative advantage says that it pays countries to trade because they are different. It is impossible for a country to have no comparative advantage in anything. It may be the least efficient at everything, but it will still have a comparative advantage in the industry in which it is relatively least bad.\\n There is no reason to assume that a country's comparative advantage will be static. If a country does what it has a comparative advantage in and sees its  INCOME  grow as a result, it can afford better education and  INFRASTRUCTURE . These, in turn, may give it a comparative advantage in other economic activities in future. \"]\n",

A  CENTRAL BANK  tries to keep the amount of credit creation below the level at which it would increase the  MONEY SUPPLY  so much that  INFLATION  accelerates.

Research has found that in countries with a lot of corruption, less of their  GDP  goes into  INVESTMENT  and they have lower  GROWTH  rates. Corrupt countries invest less in education, a sector of the economy that pays big economic dividends but small bribes, than do clean countries, thereby reducing their  HUMAN CAPITAL . They also attract less  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT .\\n There is no such thing as good corruption, but some sorts of corruption are less bad than others. Some economists point to similarities between bribery and paying taxes or buying a licence to operate. Where it is predictable - where the briber knows what to pay and can be sure of getting what it pays for--corruption harms the economy far less than where it is capricious.\\n The absence of corruption has huge economic benefits, however, by allowing the development of institutions that enable a market economy to function efficiently. In many of the world's more corrupt countries, the distinction between private interest and public duty is still unfamiliar. Countries that have made graft the exception rather than the rule in the conduct of public affairs have been helped to grow by the emergence of institutions such as an independent judiciary, a free press, a well-paid civil service and, perhaps crucially, an economy in which  FIRMS  have to compete for customers and  CAPITAL . \"]\n",

They argue that the less tax is levied on capital gains, the greater is the incentive to put capital to productive use. Put another way, capital gains  tax is effectively a tax on  CAPITALISM .

      "['C', 'Competition', '\\n     The more competition there is, the more likely are  FIRMS  to be efficient and  PRICES  to be low. Economists have identified several different sorts of competition.  PERFECT COMPETITION  is the most competitive market imaginable in which everybody is a price taker. Firms earn only normal profits, the bare minimum  PROFIT  necessary to keep them in business. If firms earn more than this (excess profits) other firms will enter the market and drive the price level down until there are only normal profits to be made.\\n Most markets exhibit some form of imperfect or  MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION . There are fewer firms than in a perfectly competitive market and each can to some degree create BARRIERS TO ENTRY. Thus firms can earn some excess profits without a new entrant being able to compete to bring prices down.\\n The least competitive market is a  MONOPOLY , dominated by a single firm that can earn substantial excess profits by controlling either the amount of  OUTPUT  in the market or the price (but not both). In this sense it is a price setter. When there are few firms in a market ( OLIGOPOLY ) they have the opportunity to behave as a monopolist through some form of collusion (see  CARTEL ). A market dominated by a single firm does not necessarily have monopoly power if it is a  CONTESTABLE MARKET . In such a market, a single firm can dominate only if it produces as efficiently as possible and does not earn excess profits. If it becomes inefficient or earns excess profits, another more efficient or less profitable firm will enter the market and dominate it instead. ']\n",

      "['C', 'Currency board', \"\\n     A means by which some countries try to defend their currency from speculative attack. A country that introduces a currency board commits itself to converting its domestic currency on demand at a fixed  EXCHANGE RATE . To make this commit ment credible, the currency board holds  RESERVES  of foreign currency (or  GOLD  or some other liquid  ASSET ) equal at the fixed rate of exchange to at least 100% of the value of the domestic currency that is issued.\\n Unlike a conventional  CENTRAL BANK , which can print  MONEY  at will, a currency board can issue domestic notes and coins only when there are enough foreign exchange reserves to back it. Under a strict currency board regime,  INTEREST RATES  adjust automatically. If investors want to switch out of domestic currency into, say, US dollars, then the  SUPPLY  of domestic currency will automatically shrink. This will cause domestic interest rates to rise, until eventually it becomes attractive for investors to hold local currency again.\\n Like any fixed exchange rate system, a currency board offers the prospect of a stable exchange rate and its strict discipline also brings benefits that ordinary exchange rate pegs lack. Profligate governments, for instance, cannot use the central bank's printing presses to fund large deficits. Hence currency boards are more credible than fixed exchange rates. The downside is that, like other fixed exchange rate systems, currency boards prevent governments from setting their own interest rates.\\n If local inflation remains higher than that of the country to which the currency is pegged, the currencies of countries with currency boards can become overvalued and uncompetitive. Governments cannot use the exchange rate to help the economy adjust to an outside  SHOCK , such as a fall in export prices or sharp shifts in capital flows. Instead, domestic  WAGES  and prices must adjust, which may not happen for many years, if ever.\\n A currency board can also put pressure on banks and other financial institutions if interest rates rise sharply as investors dump local currency. For emerging markets with fragile banking systems, this can be a dangerous drawback. Furthermore, a classic currency board, unlike a central bank, cannot act as a  LENDER OF LAST RESORT . A conventional central bank can stem a potential  banking panic by lending money freely to banks that are feeling the pinch. A classic currency board cannot, although in practice some currency boards have more freedom than the classic description implies. The danger is that if they use this freedom, governments may cause currency speculators and others to doubt the government's commitment to living within the strict disciplines imposed by the currency board.  Argentina's decision to devalue the peso amid economic and political crisis in January 2002, a decade after it adopted a currency board, showed that adopting a currency board is neither a panacea nor a guarantee that an exchange rate backed by one will remain fixed come what may. \"]\n",
      "['C', 'Classical economics', '\\n     The dominant theory of economics from the 18th century to the 20th century, when it evolved into  NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS . Classical economists, who included Adam SMITH, David  RICARDO  and John Stuart Mill, believed that the pursuit of individual self-interest produced the greatest possible economic benefits for society as a whole through the power of the  INVISIBLE HAND . They also believed that an economy is always in  EQUILIBRIUM  or moving towards it.\\n Equilibrium was ensured in the  LABOUR  market by movements in  WAGES  and in the  CAPITAL  market by changes in the rate of  INTEREST . The  INTEREST RATE  ensured that total  SAVINGS  in an economy were equal to total  INVESTMENT . In  DISEQUILIBRIUM , higher interest rates encouraged more saving and less investment, and lower rates meant less saving and more investment. When the  DEMAND  for labour rose or fell, wages would also rise or fall to keep the workforce at  FULL EMPLOYMENT .\\n In the 1920s and 1930s, John Maynard  KEYNES  attacked some of the main beliefs of classical and neo-classical economics, which became unfashionable. In particular, he argued that the rate of interest was determined or influenced by the speculative actions of investors in  BONDS  and that wages were inflexible downwards, so that if demand for labour fell, the result would be higher  UNEMPLOYMENT  rather than cheaper workers.

Countries can slap duties on cheap imports that they judge are being dumped in their markets. Often this amounts to thinly disguised  PROTECTIONISM  against more efficient foreign firms.\\n In practice, genuine predatory pricing is rare - certainly much rarer than anti-dumping actions - because it relies on the unlikely ability of a single producer to dominate a world market.

      "['D', 'Depression', \"\\n     A bad, depressingly prolonged  RECESSION  in economic activity. The textbook definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of declining  OUTPUT . A slump is where output falls by at least 10%; a depression is an even deeper and more prolonged slump.\\n The most famous example is the Great Depression of the 1930s. After growing strongly during the 'roaring 20s', the American economy (among others) went into prolonged recession. Output fell by 30%.  UNEMPLOYMENT  soared and stayed high: in 1939 the jobless rate was still 17% of the workforce. Roughly half of the 25,000 BANKS in the United States failed. An attempt to stimulate growth, the New Deal, was the most far-reaching example of active  FISCAL POLICY  then seen and greatly extended the role of the state in the American economy. However, the depression only ended with the onset of preparations to enter the second world war.\\n Why did the Great Depression happen? It is not entirely clear, but forget the popular explanation: that it all went wrong with the Wall Street stockmarket crash of October 1929; that the slump persisted because policymakers just sat there; and that it took the New Deal to put things right. As early as 1928 the Federal Reserve, worried about financial  SPECULATION  and inflated STOCK \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPRICES, began raising interest rates. In the spring of 1929, industrial production started to slow; the recession started in the summer, well before the stockmarket lost half of its value between October 24th and mid-November. Coming on top of a recession that had already begun, the crash set the scene for a severe contraction but not for the decade-long slump that ensued.\\n So why did a bad downturn keep getting worse, year after year, not just in the United States but also around the globe? In 1929 most of the world was on the  GOLD  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSTANDARD, which should have helped stabilise the American economy. As  DEMAND  in the United States slowed its  IMPORTS  fell, its  BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  moved further into surplus and gold should have flowed into the country, expanding the  MONEY SUPPLY  and boosting the economy. But the Fed, which was still worried about easy  CREDIT  and speculation, dampened the impact of this adjustment mechanism, and instead the money supply got tighter. Governments everywhere, hit by falling demand, tried to reduce imports through TARIFFS, causing international trade to collapse. Then American banks started to fail, and the Fed let them. As the crisis of confidence spread more banks failed, and as people rushed to turn bank deposits into cash the money supply collapsed.\\n Bad  MONETARY POLICY  was abetted by bad fiscal policy. Taxes were raised in 1932 to help balance the budget and restore confidence. The New Deal brought  DEPOSIT INSURANCE  and boosted  GOVERNMENT  spending, but it also piled taxes on business and sought to prevent excessive  COMPETITION . Price controls were brought in, along with other anti-business regulations. None of this stopped - and indeed may well have contributed to - the economy falling into recession again in 1937-38,  after a brief recovery starting in 1935. \"]\n",

In books such as  The Other Path  and  The Mystery of Capital , he argued that, in developing countries,  capitalism  will thrive in the  long run  only if legal systems change so that most of the people feel that the law is on their side. One of the best ways to achieve this is to give full legal protection to the de facto property rights that are observed informally by the poor, such as when a community recognises that a certain family is entitled to occupy a particular piece of land.  According to his research, carried out in several countries with his think tank, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, such informal property rights cover  assets  (notably land and housing) worth many billions of dollars. Informal systems of property rights usually make such assets \"dead  capital \", meaning that it is hard to use them as  collateral  for a loan, which might be used to start a business, for example. He argues with that an efficient, inclusive legal system preceded rapid development in every rich country and that bringing these rights into the formal legal system of poor, developing countries will unleash this hitherto dead capital and spur growth. His ideas have been much talked about but little acted upon. ']\n",

However, before 1930 deflation (falling prices) was as likely as  INFLATION . On the eve of the first world war, for example, prices in the UK, overall, were almost exactly the same as they had been at the time of the great fire of London in 1666.\\n Deflation is a persistent fall in the general price level of goods and  SERVICES . It is not to be confused with a decline in prices in one economic sector or with a fall in the  INFLATION  rate (which is known as  DISINFLATION ).\\n Sometimes deflation can be harmless, perhaps even a good thing, if lower prices lift real  INCOME  and hence spending power. In the last 30 years of the 19th century, for example, consumer prices fell by almost half in the United States, as the expansion of railways and advances in industrial technology brought cheaper ways to make everything. Yet annual real  GDP  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t GROWTH  over the period averaged more than 4%.\\n Deflation is dangerous, however, more so even than inflation, when it reflects a sharp slump in  DEMAND , excess  CAPACITY  and a shrinking  MONEY SUPPLY , as in the Great  DEPRESSION  of the early 1930s. In the four years to 1933, American consumer prices fell by 25% and real  GDP  by 30%. Runaway deflation of this sort can be much more damaging than runaway inflation, because it creates a vicious spiral that is hard to escape. The expectation that prices will be lower tomorrow may encourage consumers to delay purchases, depressing demand and forcing  FIRMS  to cut prices by even more. Falling prices also inflate the real burden of  DEBT  (that is, increase real  INTEREST  rates) causing  BANKRUPTCY  and  BANK  failure. This makes deflation particularly dangerous for economies that have large amounts of corporate debt. Most serious of all, deflation can make  MONETARY POLICY  ineffective: nominal interest rates cannot be negative, so real rates can get stuck too high. ']\n",
      "['D', 'Developing countries', \"\\n     A euphemism for the world's poor countries, also known, often optimistically, as emerging economies. Some four-fifths of the world's 6\\xa0billion people already live in developing countries, many of them in abject  POVERTY . Developing countries  account for less than one-fifth of total world  GDP .\\n Economists disagree about how likely--and how fast--developing countries are to become developed.  NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS  predicts that poor countries will grow faster than richer ones. The reason is  DIMINISHING RETURNS  on  CAPITAL . Since poor countries start with less capital, they should reap higher  RETURNS  than a richer country with more capital from each slice of new  INVESTMENT . But this  CATCH-UP EFFECT  (or convergence) is not supported by the data. For one thing, there is, in fact, no such thing as a typical developing country. The official developing world includes the (sometimes) fast-growing Asian tigers and the poorest nations in Africa. Studies of the relationship between  GROWTH  and  GDP  per head in rich and poor countries found no evidence that poorer countries grew faster. Indeed, if anything, poorer countries have grown more slowly.\\n DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS  has argued that this is because poor countries have unique problems that require different policy solutions from those offered by conventional developed-world economics. But new  ENDOGENOUS  growth theory instead argues that there is conditional convergence. Hold constant such factors as a country's fertility rate, its  HUMAN CAPITAL  and its  GOVERNMENT  policies (proxied by the share of current government spending in  GDP ), and poorer countries generally grow faster than richer ones. Since, in reality, other factors are not constant (not all countries have the same level of human capital or the same government policies), absolute convergence does not happen.\\n Government policies seem to be crucial. Countries with broadly free-market policies - in particular,  FREE TRADE  and the maintenance of secure  PROPERTY RIGHTS --have raised their growth rates. (Although some economists argue that the Asian tigers are an exception to this free-market rule.) Open economies have grown much faster on average than closed economies. Higher  PUBLIC SPENDING  relative to  GDP  is usually associated with slower growth. Furthermore, high  INFLATION  is bad for growth and so is political instability. The poorest countries can indeed catch up. Their chances of doing so are maximised by policies that give a greater role to  COMPETITION  and incentives, at home and abroad.\\n Despite starting with a big disadvantage, there is evidence that some developing countries do not help themselves because they squander the resources they have. Institutions that produce effective governance of an economy are crucial. Those countries that use their resources well can grow quickly. Indeed, the world's fastest-growing economies are a small subgroup of exceptional performers among the poor countries. \"]\n",

Economists mostly regard derivatives as a good thing, allowing more precise pricing of financial  RISK  and better  RISK MANAGEMENT . However, they concede that when derivatives are misused the  LEVERAGE  that is often an integral part of them can have devastating consequences.

The proposition on which development economics was built was that poor countries were intrinsically different from rich ones and so needed their own set of economic models. Some development economists argued, for instance, that the self-interested, rational individual ( HOMO ECONOMICUS ) did not exist in traditional tribal societies. They claimed that because many poor countries had large agricultural populations and were often dependent on a few COMMODITY EXPORTS for foreign exchange earnings, economic policies that suited rich countries would not work for them. With hindsight, much of this was misguided, and policies based on it had disastrous effects. Development economists believed that the state had to play a big role in fostering modernisation. Instead, the result was huge, inefficient \\xadbureaucracies riddled with  CORRUPTION , massive  BUDGET  deficits and rampant  INFLATION . During the 1990s, most governments of  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  started to reverse these policies and undo the damage they had done by introducing policies based on similar economic models to those that had worked in rich countries. However, the  sequencing  of these new policies seemed to make a big difference to how well they worked.  Doing the right things in the right order is crucial. ']\n",

Some of these countries have to pay so much in  INTEREST  each year to foreign lenders that they  have little  MONEY  left to spend on the long-term solutions to their  POVERTY , such as educating their workers and building a modern  INFRASTRUCTURE . In 1998 the  WORLD BANK  calculated that around 40 of the world's poorest countries had an 'unsustainably high' debt burden: the present value of their total debts was more than 220% of their  EXPORTS .\\n Debt forgiveness has potential drawbacks. For instance, there is a risk of  MORAL HAZARD . If countries that borrow too much are let off their financial obligations, poor countries may feel they have nothing to lose by borrowing as much as they can. This is why policymakers often argue that debt forgiveness should come with a  CONDITIONALITY  clause, for instance, a requirement that countries have a track record of implementing economic reforms designed to prevent a repeat of the errors that first created the need for debt forgiveness. This is the approach taken by the World Bank's HIPC (highly indebted poor country) initiative, launched in 1996 and expanded in 1999.

A big downside is that the country hands over control of  MONETARY POLICY  to the Federal Reserve, and the right  INTEREST RATE  for the United States may not be appropriate for the dollarised country, if that country and the United States do not constitute an  OPTIMAL CURRENCY AREA .

      "['D', 'Demand', '\\n     One of the two words economists use most; the other is  SUPPLY . These are the twin driving forces  of the market economy. Demand is not just about measuring what people want; for economists, it refers to the amount of a good or service that people are both willing and able to buy. The  DEMAND CURVE  measures the relationship between the  PRICE  of a good and the amount of it demanded. Usually, as the price rises, fewer people are willing and able to buy it; in other words, demand falls (but see  GIFFEN GOODS ,  NORMAL GOODS  and  INFERIOR GOODS ). When demand changes, economists explain this in one of two ways. A movement along the demand curve occurs when a price change alters the quantity demanded; but if the price were to go back to where it was before, so would the amount demanded. A shift in the demand curve occurs when the amount demanded would be different from what it was previously at any chosen price, for example, if there is no change in the market price, but demand rises or falls. The slope of the demand curve indicates the  ELASTICITY  of demand. For approaches to modelling demand see  REVEALED PREFERENCE .\\n Policymakers seek to manipulate aggregate demand to keep the economy growing as fast as is possible without pushing up  INFLATION . Keynesians try to manage demand through  FISCAL POLICY ; monetarists prefer to use the  MONEY SUPPLY . Neither approach hasbeen especially successful in practice, particularly when attempting to manage short-term demand through  FINE TUNING . ']\n",

In the 200 years since Thomas Malthus forecast that  POPULATION  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t GROWTH  would result in mass starvation, dire predictions based on demographic trends have come to be taken with a pinch of salt. Even so, demography does matter. In developed countries, economists have studied the impact of the  post-war 'baby-boomer' population bulge as it has grown older. In the 1980s, as the bulge dominated the workforce, it may have contributed to a sharp, if temporary, rise in  UNEMPLOYMENT  in many countries. Boomers starting to save for retirement may have increased  DEMAND  for  SHARES , so fuelling the  BULL  stockmarket of the 1990s; as they retire and sell their shares for spending  MONEY , they may cause a long  BEAR  market. Furthermore, as they become elderly and retire, health-care spending and retirement pensions are likely to eat up a growing share of  GDP . To the extent that these are provided by the state, this will mean increasing  PUBLIC SPENDING  and higher taxes. But whether they are provided by the state or by the private sector, the ageing of baby-boomers will impose a growing financial burden on the younger workers that have to support them (see  replacement rate ). Economists have tried to measure the extent of this burden using  generational accounting , which looks at the amount of wealth transferred from one generation to another over the lifetimes of the members of each generation.\\n Economists have also developed many different theories to explain why populations grow and why the fertility rate slowed sharply, to below the replacement rate, in many developed countries during the 1990s. One explanation is based on the notion that people have children so that there is somebody to look after them in old age. Fertility rates fell because the state increasingly looked after retired people, and infant mortality rates were lower so fewer births were required to ensure that there were some children around in the parental dotage. Also, with a lower  PROBABILITY  of a child dying, it paid the parents to have fewer children and to channel their energy and resources into maximising the  HUMAN CAPITAL  of the few. Alternatively, it may have had something to do with an important  INNOVATION : the cheap and easy availability of reliable contraception. \"]\n",
      "['D', 'Deposit insurance', \"\\n     Protection for your  SAVINGS , in case your  BANK  goes Bust. Arrangements vary around the world, but in most countries deposit insurance is required by the  GOVERNMENT  and paid for by banks (and, ultimately, their customers), which contribute a small slice of their  ASSETS  to a central, usually government-run, insurance fund. If a bank defaults, this fund guarantees its customers' deposits, at least up to a certain amount. By reassuring banks' customers that their cash is protected, deposit insurance aims to prevent them from panicking and causing a bank run, and thereby reduces  SYSTEMIC RISK . The United States introduced it in 1933, after a massive bank panic led to widespread  BANKRUPTCY , deepening its  DEPRESSION .\\n The downside of deposit insurance is that it creates a  MORAL HAZARD . By insulating depositors from defaults, deposit insurance reduces their incentive to monitor banks closely. Also banks can take greater risks, safe in the knowledge that there is a state-financed safety net to catch them if they fall.\\n There are no easy solutions to this moral hazard. One approach is to monitor what banks do very closely. This is easier said than done, not least because of the high cost. Another is to ensure  CAPITAL  adequacy by requiring banks to set aside, just in case, specified amounts of capital when they take on different amounts of  RISK .\\n Alternatively, the state safety net could be shrunk, by splitting banks into two types: super-safe, government-insured'narrow banks' that stick to traditional business and invest only in secure assets; and uninsured institutions, 'broad banks', that could range more widely under a much lighter regulatory system. Savers who invested in a broad bank would probably earn much higher  RETURNS  because it could invest in riskier assets; but they would also lose their shirts if it went bust.\\n Yet another possible answer is to require every bank to finance a small proportion of its assets by selling subordinated  DEBT  to other institutions, with the stipulation that the  YIELD  on this debt must not be more than so many (say 50) basis points higher  than the rate on a corresponding risk-free instrument. Subordinated debt (uninsured certificates of deposit) is simply junior debt. Its holders are at the back of the queue for their  MONEY  if the bank gets into trouble and they have no safety net. Investors will buy subordinated debt at a yield quite close to the risk-free  INTEREST RATE  only if they are sure the bank is low risk. To sell its debt, the bank will have to persuade informed investors of this. If it cannot convince them it cannot operate. This exploits the fact that bankers know more about banking than do their supervisors. It asks banks not to be good citizens but to look only to their profits. Unlike the present regime, it exploits all the available  INFORMATION  and properly aligns everybody's incentives. This ingenious idea was first tried in Argentina, where it became a victim of the country's economic, banking and political crisis of 2001-02 before it really had a chance to prove itself. \"]\n",

Furthermore, high rates of  INCOME TAX  were viewed as politically unpopular.

Over the years, economists and politicians have often changed their minds about whether it is a good idea to try to hold a country's exchange rate steady, rather than let it be decided by  MARKET FORCES . For two decades after the second world war, many of the major currencies were fixed under the  BRETTON WOODS  agreement. During the following two decades, the number of currencies allowed to float increased, although in the late 1990s a number of European currencies were permanently fixed under  ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION  and some other countries established a  CURRENCY BOARD .\\n When  CAPITAL  can flow easily around the world, countries cannot fix their exchange rate and at the same time maintain an independent  MONETARY POLICY . They must choose between the confidence and stability provided by a fixed exchange rate and the control over  INTEREST RATE  policy offered by a floating exchange rate. On the face of it, in a world of capital  MOBILITY  a more flexible exchange rate seems the best bet. A floating currency will force  FIRMS  and investors to  HEDGE  against fluctuations, not lull them into a false sense of stability. It should make foreign  BANKS  more circumspect about lending. At the same time it gives policymakers the option of devising their own monetary policy. But floating exchange rates have a big drawback: when moving from one  EQUILIBRIUM  to another, currencies can overshoot and become highly unstable, especially if large amounts of capital flow in or out of a country. This instability has real economic costs.\\n To get the best of both worlds, many emerging economies have tried a hybrid approach, loosely tying their exchange rate either to a single foreign currency, such as the dollar, or to a basket of currencies. But the currency crises of the late 1990s, and the failure of Argentina's currency board, led many economists to conclude that, if not a currency union such as the  euro , the best policy may be to have a freely floating exchange rate. \"]\n",
      "['E', 'Economic and monetary union', '\\n     In January 1999, 11 of the 15 countries in the  EUROPEAN UNION  merged their national currencies into a single European currency, the  EURO . This decision was motivated partly by politics and partly by hoped-for economic benefits from the creation of a single, integrated European economy. These benefits included currency stability and low  INFLATION , underwritten by an independent  EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK  (a particular boon for countries with poor inflation records, such as Italy and Spain, but less so for traditionally low-inflation Germany). Furthermore, European businesses and individuals stood to save from handling one currency rather than many. Comparing  PRICES  and  WAGES  across the  euro zone  became easier, increasing  COMPETITION  by making it easier for companies to sell throughout the euro-zone and for consumers to shop around.\\n Forming the single currency also involved big risks, however. Euro members gave up both the right to set their own  INTEREST  rates and the option of moving exchange rates against each other. They also agreed to limit their  budget  deficits under a  stability and growth pact . Some economists argued that this loss of flexibility could prove costly if their economies did not behave as one and could not easily adjust in other ways. How well the euro-zone functions will depend on how closely it resembles what economists call an  OPTIMAL CURRENCY AREA . When the euro economies are not growing in unison, a common  MONETARY POLICY  risks being too loose for some and too tight for others. If so, there may need to be large  TRANSFERS  of funds from regions doing well to those doing badly. But if the effects of shocks persist, fiscal transfers would merely delay the day of reckoning; ultimately,  WAGES  or people (or both) would have to shift.   In its first few years,the euro fell sharply against the dollar, though it recovered during late 2002. Sluggish growth in some European economies led to intense pressure for interest rate cuts, and to the stability and growth pact being breached, though not scrapped.

They oppose  FREE TRADE  because they favour self-sufficiency ( AUTARKY ), or at least so-called  FAIR TRADE , and because they believe it encourages poorer countries to destroy their natural resources in order to get rich quick. Although few professional economists would share these views, in recent years many attempts have been made to incorporate environmental concerns within mainstream economics.\\n The traditional measure of  GDP  incorporates only those things that are paid for; this may include things that reduce the overall quality of life, including harming the environment. For instance, cleaning up an oil spill will increase  GDP  if people are paid for the clean-up. Attempts have  been made to devise an alternative environmentally friendly measure of  NATIONAL INCOME , but so far progress has been limited. At the very least, traditional economists increasingly agree that maximising GDP growth does not necessarily equal maximising social  WELFARE .\\n Much of the damage done to the environment may be a result of externalities. An  EXTERNALITY  can arise when people engaged in economic activity do not have to take into account the full costs of what they are doing. For instance, car drivers do not have to bear the full cost of making their contribution to global warming, even though their actions may one day impose a huge financial burden on society. One way to reduce externalities is to tax them, say, through a fuel tax. Another is prohibition, say, limiting car drivers to one gallon of fuel per week. This could result in black markets, however. Allowing trade in pollution rights may encourage 'efficient pollution', with the pollution permits ending up in the hands of those for which pollution has the greatest economic upside. As this would still allow some environmental destruction, it might be unpopular with extreme greens.\\n There may be a case for international eco markets. For instance, people in rich countries might pay people in poor countries to stop doing activities that do environmental damage outside the poor countries, or that rich people disapprove of, such as chopping down the rain forests. Choices on environmental policy, notably on measures to reduce the threat of global warming, involve costs today with benefits delayed until the distant future. How are these choices to be made? Traditional  COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS  does not help much. In measuring costs and benefits in the far distant future, two main things seem to intervene and spoil the conventional calculations. One is uncertainty. We know nothing about what the state of the world will be in 2200. The other is how much people today are willing to pay in order to raise the welfare of others who are so remote that they can barely be imagined, yet who seem likely to be much better off materially than people today. Some economists take the view that the welfare of each future generation should be given the same weight in the analysis as the welfare of today's. This implies that a much lower  DISCOUNT RATE  should be used than the one appropriate for short-term projects. Another option is to use a high discount rate for costs and benefits arising during the first 30 or so years, then a lower rate or rates for more distant periods. Many studies by economists and psychologists have found that people do in fact discount the distant future at lower rates than they apply to the near future. \"]\n",
      "['E', 'Externality', '\\n     An economic side-effect. Externalities are costs or benefits arising from an economic activity that affect somebody other than the people engaged in the economic activity and are not reflected fully in  PRICES . For instance, smoke pumped out by a factory may impose clean-up costs on nearby residents; bees kept to produce honey may pollinate plants belonging to a nearby farmer, thus boosting his crop. Because these costs and benefits do not form part of the calculations of the people deciding whether to go ahead with the economic activity they are a form of  MARKET FAILURE , since the amount of the activity carried out if left to the free market will be an inefficient use of resources. If the externality is beneficial, the market will provide too little; if it is a cost, the market will supply too much.\\n One potential solution is  REGULATION : a ban, say. Another, when the externality is negative, is a tax on the activity or, if the externality is positive, a  SUBSIDY . But the most efficient solution to externalities is to require them to be included in the costings of those engaged in the economic activity, so there is self-regulation. For instance, the externality of pollution can be solved by creating  PROPERTY RIGHTS  over clean air, entitling their owner to a fee if they are infringed by a factory pumping out smoke. According to the Coase theorem (named after a Nobel prize-winning economist, Ronald Coase), it does not matter who has ownership, so long as property rights are fully allocated and completely free trade of all property rights is possible.

If the percentage change in quantity is more than the percentage change in price, the good is price elastic; if it is less, the good is  INELASTIC .\\n INCOME  elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded changes when income increases.\\n Cross-elasticity shows how the demand for one good (say, coffee) changes when the price of another good (say, tea) changes. If they are  SUBSTITUTE GOODS  (tea and coffee) the cross-elasticity will be positive: an increase in the price of tea will increase demand for coffee. If they are  COMPLEMENTARY GOODS  (tea and teapots) the cross-elasticity will be negative.

The efficient market hypothesis says that the  PRICE  of a financial  ASSET  reflects all the  INFORMATION  available and responds only to unexpected news. Thus prices can be regarded as optimal estimates of true investment value at all times. It is impossible for investors to predict whether the price will move up or down (future price movements are likely to follow a  RANDOM WALK ), so on  AVERAGE  an investor is unlikely to beat the market. This belief underpins \\xad ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY , the  CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL  and concepts such as  BETA .\\n The hypothesis had few critics among financial economists during the 1960s and 1970s, but it has come under increasing attack since then. The fact that financial prices were far more volatile than appeared to be justified by new information, and that financial bubbles sometimes formed, led economists to question the theory.  BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS  has challenged one of the main sources of market efficiency, the idea that all investors are fully rational  HOMO ECONOMICUS . Some economists have noted the fact that information gathering is a costly process, so it is unlikely that all available information will be reflected in prices. Others have pointed to the fact that  ARBITRAGE  can become more costly, and thus less likely, the further away from fundamentals prices move.  The efficient market hypothesis is now one of the most controversial and well-studied propositions in  ECONOMICS , although no consensus has been reached on which markets, if any, are efficient.

This effectively insures producers against non-payment. When governments compete aggressively with export credits to win business for domestic  FIRMS  the sums involved can become large.

Possible sanctions include limiting export or import trade with the target; constraining  INVESTMENT  in the target; and preventing  TRANSFERS  of  MONEY  involving citizens or the government of the target. Sanctions can be multi\\xadlateral, with many countries acting together, perhaps under the auspices of the United Nations, or unilateral, when one country takes action on its own.\\n How effective sanctions are is debatable. According to one study, between 1914 and 1990 there were 116 occasions on which various countries imposed economic sanctions. Two-thirds of these failed to achieve their stated goals. The cost to the country imposing sanctions can be large, particularly when it is acting unilaterally. It is estimated that in 1995 imposing sanctions on other countries cost the American economy over $15 billion in lost exports and 200,000 in lost jobs in export industries.\\n Widely considered a notable success was the use of economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa, although some economists question how big a part the sanctions actually played. Clearly important was the fact that the sanctions were imposed multilaterally by the international community, so there were comparatively few breaches of the restrictions. But, arguably, the most crucial factor in persuading the government in Pretoria to cave in was that foreign companies fearing that their  SHARE  price would fall because their investments in South Africa would attract bad publicity voluntarily chose for commercial reasons to disinvest. \"]\n",

It can be used to influence the level of demand in the economy, usually with the twin goals of getting  unemployment  as low as possible without triggering excessive  inflation . At times it has been deployed to manage short-term demand through  fine tuning , although since the end of the  keynesian  era it has more often been targeted on long-term goals, with monetary policy more often used for shorter-term adjustments. \\t For a government, there are two main issues in setting fiscal policy: what should be the overall stance of policy, and what form should its individual parts take? \\t Some economists and policymakers argue for a  balanced budget . Others say that a persistent  deficit  (public spending exceeding revenue) is acceptable provided, in accordance with the  golden rule , the deficit is used for  investment  (in  infrastructure , say) rather than  consumption . However, there may be a danger that public-sector investment will result in the  crowding out  of more productive private investment. Whatever the overall stance on average over an economic cycle, most economists agree that fiscal policy should be counter-cyclical, aiming to automatically stabilise demand by increasing public spending relative to revenue when the economy is struggling and increasing taxes relative to spending towards the top of the cycle. For instance, social ( welfare ) handouts from the state usually increase during tough times, and fiscal drag boosts government revenue when the economy is growing. \\t As for the bits and pieces making up fiscal policy, one debate is about how high public spending should be relative to gdp. In the United States and many Asian countries, public spending is less than 30% of  gdp ; in European countries, such as Germany and Sweden, it has been as high as 40-50%. Some economic studies suggest that lower public spending relative to GDP results in higher rates of  growth , though this conclusion is controversial.

By contrast, when the economy grows,  income , spending and corporate  profit  rise. So the tax-take increases too, without any need for government action.

Since the 1960s, however, sophisticated economic theories of how firms work have been developed. These have examined why firms grow at different rates and tried to model the normal life cycle of a company, from fast-growing start-up to lumbering mature business. The aim is to explain when it pays to conduct an activity within a firm and when it pays to externalise it through short- or long-term arrangements with outsiders, be they individuals, exchanges or other companies. The theories also look at the economic consequences of the different incentives influencing individuals working within companies, tackling issues such as pay,  agency costs  and corporate governance structures.

The trouble was and is, partly because of the inadequacies of economic  forecasting , that these frequent adjustments were and are often mistaken, making the economy's  growth  path more, rather than less, erratic. In the 1990s, fine tuning was increasingly shunned by  central banks  and governments, which stopped trying to manage short-term demand and instead aimed to pursue long-term macroeconomic goals, which required fewer adjustments to policy.

This is done mostly by companies as opposed to financial institutions, which prefer indirect  investment  abroad such as buying small parcels of a country's supply of  shares  or  bonds . Foreign direct investment (FDI) grew rapidly during the 1990s before slowing a bit, along with the global economy, in the early years of the 21st century. Most of this investment went from one  oecd  country to another, but the share going to developing countries, especially in Asia, increased steadily. \\t There was a time when economists considered fdi as a substitute for trade. Building factories in foreign countries was one way of jumping  tariff  barriers. Now economists typically regard FDI and trade as complementary. For example, a firm can use a factory in one country to supply neighbouring markets. Some investments, especially in  services  industries, are essential prerequisites for selling to foreigners. Who would buy a Big Mac in London if it had to be sent from New York? \\t Governments used to be highly suspicious of FDI, often regarding it as corporate imperialism. Nowadays they are more likely to court it. They hope that investors will create jobs, and bring expertise and technology that will be passed on to local  firms  and workers, helping to sharpen up their whole economy. Furthermore, unlike financial investors, multinationals generally invest directly in plant and equipment. Since it is hard to uproot a chemicals factory, these investments, once made, are far more enduring than the flows of  hot money  that whisk in and out of emerging markets (see  developing countries ). \\t mergers and acquisitions  are a significant form of FDI. For instance, in 1997, more than 90% of FDI into the United States took the form of mergers rather than of setting up new subsidiaries and opening factories. \"]\n",

Measured by the volume of  imports  and  exports , world trade has become increasingly free in the years since the second world war. A fall in barriers to trade, as a result of the  general agreement on tariffs and trade  and its successor, the  world trade organisation , has helped stimulate this  growth . The volume of world merchandise trade at the start of the 21st century was about 17 times what it was in 1950, and the world's total  output  was not even six times as big.  The ratio of world exports to  gdp  had more than doubled since 1950. Of this, trade in manufactured goods was worth three times the value of trade in  services , although the share of services trade was growing fast. \\t For economists, the benefits of free trade are explained by the theory of comparative advantage, with each country doing those things in which it is comparatively more efficient. As long as each country specialises in products in which it has a  comparative advantage , trade will be mutually beneficial. Some critics of free trade argue that trade with  developing countries , where wages are usually lower and working hours longer than in developed countries, is unfair and will wipe out jobs in high-wage countries. They want  autarky  or  fair trade . \\t Real-world trade patterns sometimes seem to challenge the theory of comparative advantage (see  new trade theory ). Most trade occurs between countries that do not have huge cost differences. The biggest trading partner of the United States, for instance, is Canada. Well over half the exports from France, Germany and Italy go to other  european union  countries. Moreover, these countries sell similar things to each other: cars made in France are exported to Germany, and German cars go to France. The main reason seems to be cross-border differences in consumer tastes. But the agricultural exports of Australia, say, or Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil, do clearly stem from their particular stock of natural resources. Also poorer countries often have more unskilled labour, so they export simple manufactures such as clothing. \"]\n",

It is usually valued at market prices; by subtracting indirect tax and adding any government  subsidy , however, GDP can be calculated at  factor cost . This measure more accurately reveals the income paid to  factors of production . Adding income earned by domestic residents from their investments abroad, and subtracting income paid from the country to investors abroad, gives the country's gross national product (GNP). \\t The effect of  inflation  can be eliminated by measuring GDP  growth  in constant real prices. However, some economists argue that hitting a nominal gdp target should be the main goal of  macroeconomic policy . This is because it would remind policymakers to take into account the effect of their decisions on inflation, as well as on growth. \\tGDP can be calculated in three ways. The income method adds the income of residents (individuals and firms) derived from the production of goods and  services . The  output  method adds the value of output from the different sectors of the economy. The expenditure method totals spending on goods and services produced by residents, before allowing for  depreciation  and  capital  consumption. As one person's output is another person's income, which in turn becomes expenditure, these three measures ought to be identical. They rarely are because of statistical imperfections. Furthermore, the output and income measures exclude unreported economic activity that takes place in the  black economy  but that may be captured by the expenditure measure. \\t GDP is disliked as an objective of economic policy by some because it is not a perfect measure of  welfare .

Economists have plenty of theories, but none of them has all the answers. \\t Adam smith  attributed growth to the  invisible hand , a view shared by most followers of  classical economics .  neo-classical economics  had a different theory of growth, devised by Robert Solow during the 1950s. This argued that a sustained increase in investment increases an economy's growth rate only temporarily: the ratio of  capital  to  labour  goes up, the  marginal  product of capital declines and the economy moves back to a long-term growth path.  output  will then increase at the same rate as the growth in the workforce (quality-adjusted, in later versions) plus a factor to reflect improvements in  productivity . \\t This theory predicts specific relationships among some basic economic statistics. Yet some of these predictions fail to fit the facts. For example,  income  disparities between countries are greater than the differences in their  savings  rates would suggest. Moreover, although the model says that economic growth ultimately depends on the rate of technological change, it fails to explain exactly what determines this rate. Technological change is treated as  exogenous . \\t Some economists argued that doing this ignored the main engine of growth. They developed a new growth theory, in which improvements in productivity were  endogenous , meaning that they were the result of things taking place within the economic model being used and not merely assumed to happen, as in the neo-classical models. Endogenous growth was due, in particular, to technological  innovation  and investments in  human capital . In looking for explanations for differences in rates of growth, including between rich and  developing countries , the new growth theory concentrates on what the incentives are in an economy to create additional human capital and to invent new products. \\t Factors determining these incentives include  government  policies. Countries with broadly free-market policies, in particular  free trade  and the maintenance of secure  property rights , typically have higher growth rates. Open economies have grown much faster on average than closed economies. Higher  public spending  relative to  gdp  is generally associated with slower growth. Also bad for growth are high  inflation  and political instability. \\t As countries grew richer during the 20th century annual growth rates declined, as a result of  diminishing returns  to capital. By 1990, most developed countries reckoned to have long-term trend growth rates of 2-2.5% a year. However, during the 1990s, growth rates started to rise, especially in the United States. Some economists said this was the result of the birth of a  new economy  based on a revolution in productivity, largely because of rapid technological innovation but also (perhaps directly stemming from the spread of new technology) to increases in the value of human capital. \"]\n",

Over its lifetime, one generation's mix of taxes paid and benefits received may differ sharply from that of another generation. Politicians are often tempted to ignore the needs of future generations (who, clearly, cannot vote at the time) in order to win the support of current generations, for instance by borrowing heavily to fund current spending. More fundamentally, because it incorporates all the tax and spending, current and future, to which a government is committed, generational accounting is a much better guide to whether fiscal policy is sustainable than measures such as the  budget  deficit, which looks only at taxes and spending in the current year. \"]\n",

This can be a source of tremendous opportunity, as new markets, workers, business partners, goods and  services  and jobs become available, but also of competitive threat, which may undermine economic activities that were viable before globalisation. \\t The term first surfaced during the 1980s to characterise huge changes that were taking place in the international economy, notably the  growth  in international trade and in flows of  capital  around the world. Globalisation has also been used to describe growing  income   inequality  between the world's rich and poor; the growing power of multinational companies relative to national  government ; and the spread of  capitalism  into former communist countries. Usually, the term is synonymous with international integration, the spread of free markets and policies of  liberalisation  and  free trade . The process is not the result simply of economic forces. The decisions of policymakers have also played an important part, although not all governments have embraced the change warmly.  \\t The driving force of globalisation has been multinational companies, which since the 1970s have constantly, and often successfully, lobbied governments to make it easier for them to put their skills and capital to work in previously protected national markets. Firms enjoying some national protection, and their (often unionised) workers, have been some of the main opponents of globalisation, along with advocates of  fair trade . \\t Despite all the talk of globalisation during the 1990s, in some respects the world economy was more integrated in the late 19th century. The labour market was certainly more global. For example, the flow of people out of Europe, 300,000 people a year in the mid-19th century, reached 1m a year after 1900.

      "['G', 'Government', '\\n     There are few more hotly debated topics in  economics  than what role the state should play in the economy. Plenty of economists provided intellectual support for state intervention during the era of big government, particularly from the 1930s to the 1980s.  keynesians  argued that the state should manage the amount of  demand  in the economy to maintain  full employment . Others advocated a  command economy , in which the government would decide price levels, oversee the allocation of scarce resources and run the most important parts of the economy (the \"commanding heights\") or, in communist countries, the entire economy. The role of the state increased at the expense of market forces. Economists provided plenty of examples of  market failure  that seemed to justify this. \\t Since the 1950s, there has been growing evidence that government intervention can also be flawed, and can often impose even greater costs on an economy than market failure. One reason is that when a government acts, it usually does so as a  monopoly , with all the attendant economic inefficiencies this implies. \\t In practice, policies of Keynesian  demand  management often resulted in  inflation , and thus lost much of their credibility. There was growing concern that public  investment  was  crowding out  superior private investment, and that other public spending on things such as health care, education and pensions was similarly discouraging private provision. Government management of commercial enterprises was often seen to be inefficient and, starting in the 1980s,  nationalisation  gave way to  privatisation . Even when the state was not directly responsible for economic activity, but instead set the rules governing private behaviour, there was evidence of  regulatory failure . High rates of  taxation  started to discourage people and companies from undertaking economic activities that would, without the tax, have been profitable; wealth creation suffered. \\t Most economists agree that there is a need for some government role in the economy. A market economy can function only if there is an adequate legal system, and, in particular, clearly defined, enforceable  property rights . The legal system is probably an example of what economists call a  public good  (although the existence in many countries and industries of some self- regulation  shows it is not always so). \\t Although politicians in many countries spent most of the period since 1980 talking about the need to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and in many cases introduced policies of privatisation,  deregulation  and  liberalisation  to help this happen, public spending has continued to increase as a share of  gdp . Within the  oecd , public spending accounted for a larger slice of GDP in 2002 than in 1990, which was in turn higher than in 1980. Indeed, it has risen during every decade since the start of the 20th century. One reason was that governments had to honour spending commitments on pensions and health care made by previous generations of politicians. ']\n",

Game theory is a technique for analysing how people, firms and governments should behave in strategic situations (in which they must interact with each other), and in deciding what to do must take into account what others are likely to do and how others might respond to what they do. For instance,  competition  between two firms can be analysed as a game in which firms play to achieve a long-term  competitive advantage  (perhaps even a  monopoly ). The theory helps each firm to develop its optimal strategy for, say, pricing its products and deciding how much to produce; it can help the firm to anticipate in advance what its competitor will do and shows how best to respond if the competitor does something unexpected. It is particularly useful for understanding behaviour in  monopolistic competition .  \\t In game theory, which can be used to describe anything from wage negotiations to arms races, a dominant strategy is one that will deliver the best results for the player, regardless of what anybody else does. One finding of game theory is that there may be a large  first-mover advantage  for companies that beat their rivals into a new market or come up with an  innovation . One special case identified by the theory is the  zero-sum game , where players see that the total winnings are fixed; for some to do well, others must lose. Far better is the positive-sum game, in which competitive interaction has the potential to make all the players richer. Another problem analysed by game theorists is the  prisoners' dilemma .

House prices often rise after  INTEREST RATE  reductions, which lower mortgage payments and thus give buyers the ability to fund a larger amount of borrowing and so offer a higher price for their new home. Strangely, people often regard house-price  INFLATION  as good news, even though it creates as many losers as gainers. They argue that rising house prices help to boost consumer confidence, and are part of the  WEALTH EFFECT : as house prices rise, people feel wealthier and so spend more. However, against this must be set a negative wealth effect. An increase in house prices makes many people worse off, such as first-time buyers and anyone planning to trade up to a better property.\\n As long as people think that their house is a vehicle for  SPECULATION , rather than merely accommodation, it seems inevitable that prices will be volatile, prone to a boom-bust cycle. As house prices rise, profits are made, tempting more speculative buyers into the market; eventually, they start to pay too much, interest rates rise,  DEMAND  falls and prices plunge. People have also invested in housing as a  HEDGE  against  INFLATION : house prices generally rise when other prices rise, whereas the real value of mortgage  DEBT  is eroded by inflation. However, when mortgage interest rates are variable (as they generally are in the UK) rather than fixed (as in the United States), they may rise painfully during times of high inflation as a result of  MACROECONOMIC POLICY  efforts to slow the pace of economic  GROWTH .  One of the reasons why the United States has long-term fixed mortgage rates is the financing provided by  government -sponsored agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, nicknamed, respectively, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Economists increasingly debate their role, especially as they have grown into some of the world's largest lenders. Supporters claim that, as well as reducing macroeconomic  volatility , they make housing more affordable, particularly for poorer people, and that other governments should play a similar role in the mortgage market.

Civil servants, doubtless under pressure from their political bosses, can usually find ways to fudge the definition of the specific purpose for which a tax is hypothecated, letting government regain control over how the  MONEY  is spent.

      "['H', 'Hysteresis', '\\n     Lagging; slow to respond. Traditionally, econo\\xadmists believed that high  UNEMPLOYMENT  was a \\xadcyclical phenomenon. Eventually, unemployment would cause people to lower their wage de\\xadmands, and so new job opportunities would arise and unemployment would fall. More recently, however, economists have suggested that some unemployed people, especially the long-term jobless, can display hysteresis. They find it hard, perhaps impossible, to return to work, even when jobs become available. For instance, unemployed workers may gradually lose the motivation, self-confidence or the self-discipline, needed to get to the workplace and fulfil job requirements. Or their skills may become outdated and redundant. State benefits for the jobless may contribute to this hysteresis by making it easier from them to stay out of work. ']\n",

      "['H', 'Hyper-inflation', '\\n     Very, very bad. Although people debate when, precisely, very rapid  INFLATION  turns into \\xadhyper-inflation (a 100% or more increase in PRICES a year, perhaps?) nobody questions that it wreaks huge economic damage. After the first world war, German prices at one point were rising at a rate of 23,000% a year before the country’s economic system collapsed, creating a political opportunity grasped by the Nazis. In former Yugoslavia in 1993, prices rose by around 20% a day. Typically, hyper-inflation quickly leads to a complete loss of confidence in a country’s currency, and causes people to search for other forms of  MONEY  that are a better store of value. These may include physical  ASSETS ,  GOLD  and foreign currency. Hyper-inflation might be easier to live with if it was stable, as people could plan on the basis that prices would rise at a fast but predictable rate. However, there are no examples of stable hyper-inflation, precisely because it occurs only when there is a crisis of confidence across the economy, with all the behavioural unpredictability this implies.

Even so, in 2001, some 54 countries were poorer than in 1990, and in 34, mostly in Africa and the former Soviet Union, life expectancy had fallen, reversing an impressive long-term trend, largely because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and crime.

In  hawala , no money moves physically between locations; nowadays it is transferred by means of a telephone call or fax between dealers in different countries. No legal contracts are involved, and recipients are given only a code number or simple token, such as a low-value banknote torn in half, to prove that money is due. Over time, transactions in opposite directions cancel each other out, so physical movement is minimised. Trust is the only  capital  that the dealers have. With it, the users of  hawala  have a worldwide money-transmission service that is cheap, fast and free of bureaucracy.  From a  government 's point of view, however, informal money networks are threatening, since they lie outside official channels that are regulated and taxed.

Born in 1899, Hayek attended his home-town University of Vienna after the first world war. He was attracted to  SOCIALISM  until he read a pioneering Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, on the subject, after which, he said, 'the world was never the same again'.\\n Hayek argued that the business cycle originated from expanded  CREDIT CREATION  by  BANKS , which was followed by  FIRMS  and people making mistaken  CAPITAL  investments in producing things for which the market turns out to be smaller (or larger) than expected.

After the second world war, Hayek was a leading member of the  CHICAGO SCHOOL  along with Milton  FRIEDMAN , among others.\\n Hayek was a noted proponent of the free-market system and a critic of state planning. His 1944 book,  The Road to Serfdom , anticipated the demise of command economies that sought to suppress  PRICE  signals.

      "['H', 'Herfindahl-Hirschman index', '\\n     A warning signal of possible  MONOPOLY .  ANTITRUST  economists often gauge the  COMPETITIVENESS  of an industry by measuring the extent to which its  OUTPUT  is concentrated among a few  FIRMS . One such measure is a Herfindahl-Hirschman index. To calculate it, take the market share of each firm in the industry, square it, then add them all up. If there are 100 equal-sized firms (a market with close to  PERFECT COMPETITION ) the index is 100. If there are four equal-sized firms (possible  OLIGOPOLY ) it will be 2,500. The higher the Herfindahl number, the more concentrated is  MARKET POWER .\\n The main virtue of the Herfindahl is its simplicity. But it has two unfortunate shortcomings. It relies on defining correctly the industry or market for which the degree of competitiveness is open to question. This is rarely simple and can be a matter of fierce debate. Even when the scope of the market is clear, the relation between the Her findahl and market power is not. When there is a  CONTESTABLE MARKET , even a firm with a Herfindahl of 10,000 (the classic definition of a monopoly) may behave as if it was in a perfectly competitive market. ']\n",

Economists increasingly argue that the accumulation of human as well as physical  CAPITAL  (plant and machinery) is a crucial ingredient of economic  GROWTH , par\\xadticularly in the  NEW ECONOMY . Even so, this conclusion is largely a matter of theory and faith, rather than the result of detailed empirical analysis. Economists have made little progress in solving the tricky problem of how to measure human capital, even within the same country over time, let alone for comparisons between countries. Levels of spending on, say, education are not necessarily a good indicator of how much human capital an education system is creating; indeed, some economists argue that higher education spending may be a consequence of a country becoming wealthy rather than a cause. Never the less, even modest estimates of the stock of human capital in most countries suggests that it would pay to greatly increase  INVESTMENT  in medical technologies that would extend the working lives of most people. The non-economic benefits would be worth having, too. ']\n",

      "['H', 'Hedge', \"\\n     Reducing your risks. Hedging involves deliberately taking on a new  RISK  that offsets an existing one, such as your exposure to an adverse change in an  EXCHANGE RATE ,  INTEREST RATE  or  COMMODITY  \\t\\t\\t\\t PRICE . Imagine, for example, that you are British and you are to be paid $1m in three months' time. You are worried that the dollar may have fallen in value by then, thus reducing the number of pounds you will be able to convert the $1m into. You can hedge away that currency risk by buying $1m of pounds at the current exchange rate (in effect) in the futures market. Hedging is most often done by commodity producers and traders, financial institutions and, increasingly, by \\xadnon-financial  FIRMS .\\n It used to be fashionable for firms to hedge by following a policy of  DIVERSIFICATION . More recently, firms have hedged using financial instruments and  DERIVATIVES . Another popular strategy is to use 'natural' hedges wherever possible. For example, if a company is setting up a factory in a particular country, it might finance it by borrowing in the currency of that country. An extension of this idea is operational hedging, for example, relocating production facilities to get a better match of costs in a given currency to revenue.\\n Hedging sounds prudent, but some economists reckon that firms should not do it because it reduces their value to shareholders. In the 1950s, two economists, Merton Miller (1923-2000) and Franco Modigliani, argued that firms make  MONEY  only if they make good investments, the kind that increase their operating cashflow. Whether these investments are financed through  DEBT ,  EQUITY  or retained earnings is irrelevant. Different methods of financing simply determine how a firm's value is divided between its various sorts of investors (for example, shareholders or bondholders), not the value itself. This surprising insight helped win each of them a Nobel prize. If they are right, there are big implications for hedging. If methods of financing and the character of financial risks do not matter, managing them is pointless. It cannot add to the firm's value; on the contrary, as hedging does not come free, doing it might actually lower that value. Moreover, argued Messrs Miller and Modigliani, if investors want to avoid the financial risks attached to holding  SHARES  in a firm, they can diversify their portfolio of shareholdings. Firms need not manage their financial risks; investors can do it for themselves. Few managers agree. \"]\n",

      "['I', 'Income tax', '\\n     A much-loathed method of  TAXATION  based on earnings. It was first collected in 1797 by the Dutch Batavian Republic. In the UK it was introduced in 1799 as a “temporary” measure to finance a war against Napoleon, abolished in 1816 and reintroduced, forever, in 1842. In most countries, people do not pay it until their  INCOME  exceeds a minimum threshold, and richer people pay a higher rate of income tax than poorer people. Since the 1980s, the unpopularity with voters of high rates of income tax and concern that high rates discourage valuable economic activity have led many governments to reduce income-tax rates. However, this has not necessarily reduced the amount of total revenue collected in income tax (see  LAFFER CURVE ). Nor do governments that have reduced income tax rates always cut other sorts of taxes; on the contrary, they have often increased them sharply to make up for any revenue lost as a result of lower rates of income tax.

      "['I', 'Index numbers', '\\n     Economists love to compile indices aggregating lots of individual data, so they can analyse broad trends in the behaviour of an economy.  INFLATION  is measured by an index of consumer (retail) PRICES. There are indices of all sorts of things that are bought and sold of which perhaps the best known are share price indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or FTSE-100. The main challenges in compiling an index are what, exactly, to include in it and what weight to give the different things that are included. A particularly tricky question is how to change an index over time. Measures of inflation are based on the price of a basket of things bought by a typical consumer. As the quality and choice of products in the basket change over time, the inflation index ought to take this into account. How, exactly, is much debated. ']\n",
      "['I', 'International aid', \"\\n     A helping hand for poor countries from rich countries. This, at least, is the intention. In practice, in many cases aid has done little good for its intended recipients (improved health care is a notable exception) and has sometimes made matters worse. Poor countries that receive lots of aid grow no faster, on average, than those that receive very little. By contrast, perhaps the most successful aid programme ever - the  MARSHALL PLAN  for rebuilding Europe after the second world war - involved rich countries giving to other hitherto rich countries.  During the second half of the 20th century rich countries gave over $1 trillion in aid to poor ones. During the 1990s, however, flows of official aid stagnated. In 2001, official aid was a little over $50 billion, roughly one quarter of the  GDP  of donor countries. On top of this were private-sector donations from  NGO s (non-government organisations) worth an estimated $6 billion. Increasingly, such sums were exceeded by private  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT . In an attempt to reinvigorate international aid, in 2000 the UN committed itself to eight ambitious Millennium Development Goals for reducing global poverty by 2015. Why has aid achieved so little? Donations have often ended up in the  OFFSHORE  \\t\\t\\t BANK  accounts of corrupt politicians and officials in poor countries.  MONEY  has often been given with strings attached, so that much of this 'tied' aid is spent on com\\xadpanies and corrupt politicians and officials in the donor country. War has ravaged many potentially beneficial aid projects. Moreover, some aid has been motivated by political goals - for example, shoring up anti-communist governments - rather than economic ones.  The lesson of history is that aid will often be wasted unless it is carefully aimed at countries with a genuine commitment to sound economic management. Analysis by the  WORLD BANK  sorted 56 aid-receiving countries by the quality of their economic management. Those with good policies (low  INFLATION , a  BUDGET  surplus and openness to trade) and good institutions (little  CORRUPTION , strong rule of law, effective bureaucracy) benefited from the aid they received. Those with poor policies and institutions did not. This accounts for the growing popularity of  CONDITIONALITY  in aid. \"]\n",

      "['I', 'Inequality', '\\n     Does economic  GROWTH  create more or less equality? Do unequal societies grow more or less slowly than equal ones? Economists have debated these questions for as long as anyone can remember. One problem is to agree which sort of inequality matters: equality of outcome (that is,  INCOME ) or of opportunity? Another is how then to measure it. Equality of opportunity, which, in theory, should make a difference to growth, because it is about giving people the chance to make the most of their  HUMAN CAPITAL , is probably beyond the ability of statisticians to analyse rigorously. The most often used measure of income inequality is the  GINI COEFFICIENT .\\n The evidence suggests that extreme poverty is more likely to slow growth than income inequality itself. This is because very poor people cannot buy the education they need to enable them to become richer and their children may be forced to forgo schooling in order to work for money.\\n Economic growth has generally reduced inequality within a country. This has been partly as a result of redistributive tax and benefits systems, which have become so significant that they may now be causing slower growth in some countries. The availability of  WELFARE  benefits may have discouraged unemployed people from seeking out a better job; and the high taxes needed to pay for the benefits may have discouraged some wealthy people from working as hard as they would have done under a friendlier tax regime.

Investment takes two main forms: direct spending on buildings, machinery and so forth, and indirect spending on financial  SECURITIES , such as  BONDS  and  SHARES .  Traditionally, economic theory says that a country's total investment must equal its total  SAVINGS . But this has never been true in the short run and, as a result of  GLOBALISATION , may never be even in the long run, as countries with low savings can attract investment from overseas and foreign savers lacking opportunities at home can invest abroad (see  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ).  The more of its  GDP  a country invests, the faster its economy should grow. This is why  GOVERNMENTS  try so hard to increase total investment, for instance, using tax breaks and subsidies, or direct  PUBLIC SPENDING  on  INFRASTRUCTURE . However, recent evidence suggests that the best way to encourage private-sector investment is to pursue stable macroeconomic policies, with low  INFLATION , low  INTEREST RATES  and low rates of  TAXATION . Curiously, economic studies have not found evidence that higher levels of investment lead to higher rates of GDP \\t\\t\\t GROWTH .

      "['I', 'Inflation target', \"\\n     The goal of  monetary policy  in many countries is to ensure that  inflation  is neither too high nor too low. It became fashionable during the 1990s to set a country's  central bank  an explicit rate of inflation to target. By 1998, some 54 central banks had an inflation target, compared with just eight at the end of 1990, the year in which New Zealand's Reserve Bank became the first to be set a target. In most industrialised countries, the target, or, typically, the mid-point of a target range, for consumer-price inflation is between 1% and 2.5%. The reason it is not zero is that official price indices overstate inflation, and that the countries would prefer a little inflation to any  deflation .   Monetary poilcy takes time to have an impact. So central banks usually base their policy changes on a forecast of inflation, not its current rate. If forecast inflation in two years' time, say, is above the target,  interest rates  are raised. If it is below target, rates are cut.\\n Why have an inflation target? Setting an inflation target usually goes hand-in-hand with allowing a central bank considerable discretion in setting policy, so  transparency  in its decision-making is vital and is therefore usually increased as part of the process of adopting a target. More fundamentally, by making it easier to judge whether policy is on track, an inflation target makes it easier to hold a central bank to account for its performance. The pay of central bankers can be designed to reward them for achieving the target. But some central bankers argue that an inflation target restricts their policy flexibility too much, which is one reason why the world's most powerful central bank, America's  Federal Reserve , has argued (so far successfully) against having one. \"]\n",

Insider trading involves using  INFORMATION  that is not in the public domain but that will move the  PRICE  of a share,  BOND  or currency when it is made public. An insider trade takes place when someone with privileged, confidential access to that information trades to take advantage of the fact that prices will move when the news gets out. This is frowned on because investors may lose confidence in  FINANCIAL MARKETS  if they see insiders taking advantage of advantageous  ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION  to enrich themselves at the expense of outsiders. But some economists reckon that insider trading leads to more efficient markets: by transmitting the inside information to the market, it makes the price of, say, a company's shares more accurate.

      "['I', 'Inflation', \"\\n     Rising  PRICES , across the board. Inflation means less bang for your buck, as it erodes the purchasing power of a unit of currency. Inflation usually refers to  CONSUMER PRICES , but it can also be applied to other prices (wholesale goods,  WAGES ,  ASSETS , and so on). It is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate of change on an  INDEX NUMBER . For much of human history inflation has not been an important part of economic life. Before 1930, prices were as likely to fall as rise during any given year, and in the long run these ups and downs usually cancelled each other out. By contrast, by the end of the 20th century, 60-year-old Americans had seen prices rise by over 1,000% during their lifetime. The most spectacular period of inflation in industrialised countries took place during the 1970s, partly as a result of sharp increases in oil prices implemented by the OPEC  CARTEL . Although these countries have mostly regained control over inflation since the 1980s, it continued to be a source of serious problems in many  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES .\\n Inflation would not do much damage if it were predictable, as everybody could build into their decision making the prospect of higher prices in future. In practice, it is unpredictable, which means that people are often surprised by price increases. This reduces economic efficiency, not least because people take fewer risks to minimise the chances of suffering too severely from a PRICE SHOCK. The faster the rate of inflation, the harder it is to predict future inflation. Indeed, this uncertainty can cause people to lose confidence in a currency as a store of value. This is why  HYPER-INFLATION  is so damaging.\\n Most economists agree that an economy is most likely to function efficiently if inflation is low. Ideally,  MACROECONOMIC POLICY  should aim for stable prices. Some economists argue that a low level of inflation can be a good thing, however, if it is a result of  INNOVATION . New products are launched at high prices, which quickly come down through  COMPETITION . Most economists reckon that  DEFLATION  (falling  AVERAGE  prices) is best avoided.\\n To keep inflation low you need to know what causes it. Economists have plenty of theories but no absolutely cast-iron conclusions. Inflation, Milton  FRIEDMAN  once said, 'is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon'. Monetarists reckon that to stabilise prices the rate of  GROWTH  of the  MONEY SUPPLY  needs to be carefully controlled. However, implementing this has proven difficult, as the relationship between measures of the money supply identified by monetarists and the rate of inflation has typically broken down as soon as policymakers have tried to target it. \\xad KEYNESIAN  economists believe that inflation can occur independently of monetary conditions. Other economists focus on the importance of institutional factors, such as whether the  INTEREST RATE  is set by politicians or (preferably) by an independent  CENTRAL BANK , and whether that central bank is set an  inflation target .\\n Is there a relationship between inflation and the level of  UNEMPLOYMENT ? In the 1950s, the  PHILLIPS CURVE  seemed to indicate that policymakers could trade off higher inflation for lower unemployment. Later experience suggested that although inflating the economy could lower unemployment in the short run, in the long run you ended up with unemployment at least as high as before and rising inflation as well. Economists then came up with the idea of the  NAIRU  (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), the rate of unemployment below which inflation would start to accelerate. However, in the late 1990s, in both the United States and the UK, the unemployment rate fell well below what most economists thought was the NAIRU yet inflation did not pick up. This caused some economists to argue that technological and other changes wrought by the  NEW ECONOMY  meant that inflation was dead. Traditionalists said it was merely resting. \"]\n",

The cost of providing assistance to those that claim is spread over all the potential claimants, thus making the insurance affordable to all.\\n Despite the enormous attraction of insurance, private markets in insurance often work badly, or not at all. Economists have identified three main reasons for this.\\n Private firms are unwilling to provide insurance if they are uncertain about the likely cost of providing sufficient cover, especially if it is potentially unlimited.\\n MORAL HAZARD  means that people with insurance may take greater risks because they know they are protected, so the insurer may get a bigger bill than it bargained for.\\n Insurers are at risk of  ADVERSE SELECTION . The people who are most likely to claim buy insurance, and those who are least likely to claim do not buy it. In this situation, setting a  PRICE  for insurance that will generate enough premiums to cover all claims is tricky, if not impossible.\\n Insurers have found ways of reducing the impact of these problems. For example, to counter adverse selection, they set higher health-insurance rates for people who smoke. To limit moral hazard, they offer reduced premiums to people who agree to pay the first so-many dollars or pounds of any claim.  An efficient system of insurance, in its broadest sense, can contribute to economic  GROWTH  by encouraging entrepreneurial risk taking and by enabling people to choose which risks they take and which they protect themselves against.

Indeed, some financiers have described an  INVESTMENT  in a financially shaky country as a 'moral-hazard play' because they were so confident that the IMF would ensure the safety of their  MONEY , one way or another. Following the economic crisis in Asia during the late 1990s, and again after the crisis in Argentina early in this decade, some policymakers argued (to no avail) for the IMF to be abolished, as the absence of its safety net would encourage more prudent behaviour all round.

Although nobody is entirely sure why innovation takes place, new theories of  ENDOGENOUS  growth try to model the innovation process, rather than just assume it happens for unexplained,  EXOGENOUS  reasons. The role of incentives seems to be particularly important. Although some innovations are the result of scientists and others engaged in the noble pursuit of know\\xadledge, most, especially their commercial applications, are the result of entrepreneurs seeking  PROFIT . Joseph  SCHUMPETER , a leading practitioner of  AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS , described this as a process of 'creative destruction'. A firm innovates successfully and is rewarded with unusually high profits, which in turn encourages rivals to come up with a superior innovation.\\n To encourage innovation, innovators must be allowed to make a decent profit, otherwise they will not incur the  RISK  and expense of trying to come up with useful innovations. Most countries have  PATENTS  and other laws protecting intellectual property, which allow innovators to enjoy a (usually temporary)  MONOPOLY  over their innovation. Economists disagree over how long that protection should last, given the inefficiencies that result from any monopoly.\\n For most of the second half of the 20th century, governments played a crucial role in funding and directing pure research and early-stage development. In the 1980s, however, legal changes in the United States started to reduce this role. One change aimed to move technological development out of the country's state-financed national laboratories. Another allowed universities, not-for-profit research institutes and small businesses doing research under government contract to keep the technologies they had developed and to apply for patents in their own names. This appears to have contributed to a surge in innovation in the United States, as government researchers and university professors teamed up with outside  FIRMS , or started their own. Hoping for similar results, many other countries have followed suit.\\n Is innovation all it is cracked up to be, or is it just change for change's sake? A few years ago, Robert Solow, a Nobel prize-winning economist, observed that 'you can see the computer age everywhere these days except in the  PRODUCTIVITY  statistics'. Although new computer technology clearly had affected people and firms in visible and obvious ways, the slowdown in productivity growth that had afflicted the American economy since the 1970s did not appear to have been reversed. Believers in the  NEW ECONOMY  argued that the 'Solow Paradox' no longer holds true; in the late 1990s, the computer revolution started to deliver the productivity growth long promised. Even so, this shows that innovation can take a long time to deliver the goods. \"]\n",

Keynes helped set up the  BRETTON WOODS  framework, but he is best known for his  General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , published in 1936 in the depths of the Great Depression.

It argued that economies could sometimes be stable (in  EQUILIBRIUM ) even when they did not have  FULL EMPLOYMENT , but that a  GOVERNMENT  could remedy this under-employment problem by increasing  PUBLIC SPENDING  and/or reducing  TAXATION , thereby increasing the level of aggregate  DEMAND  in the economy. Many politicians picked up on these ideas. As President Richard Nixon observed in 1971, 'We are all Keynesians now.' However, it is much debated whether Keynes would have supported the way many of them put his thoughts into practice.   Keynes identified the economic importance of  ANIMAL SPIRITS . Making and losing fortunes in the \\xad FINANCIAL MARKETS  led him to refer to the 'casino  CAPITALISM ' of the stockmarket. He also noted that 'there is nothing so dangerous as the pursuit of a rational  INVESTMENT  policy in an irrational world'.

Initially, higher tax rates would increase revenue, but at some point further increases in tax rates would cause revenue to fall, for instance by discouraging people from working. The curve became an icon of supply-side  ECONOMICS . Some economists said that it proved that most governments could raise more revenue by cutting tax rates, an argument that was often cited in the 1980s by the tax-cutting governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Other economists reckoned that most countries were still at a point on the curve at which raising tax rates would increase revenue. The lack of empirical evidence meant that nobody could really be sure where the United States and other countries were on the Laffer curve. However, after the Reagan administration cut tax rates revenue fell at first. American tax rates were already low compared with some countries, especially in continental Europe, and it remains possible that these countries are at a point on the Laffer curve where cutting tax rates would pay.

For instance, suppose that everybody worked 10% fewer hours.  FIRMS  would need to hire more workers. Hey presto,  UNEMPLOYMENT  would shrink.\\n In 1891, an economist, D.F. Schloss, described such thinking as the lump of labour fallacy because, in reality, the amount of work to be done is not fixed.  GOVERNMENT -imposed restrictions on the amount of work people may do can actually reduce the  EFFICIENCY  of the labour market, thereby increasing  UNEMPLOYMENT . Shorter hours will create more jobs only if weekly pay is also cut (which workers are likely to resist) otherwise costs per unit of output will rise. Not all labour costs vary with the number of hours worked.  FIXED COSTS , such as recruitment and training, can be substantial, so it will cost a firm more to hire two part-time workers than one full-timer. Thus a cut in the working week may raise  AVERAGE  costs per unit of  OUTPUT  and cause firms to buy fewer total hours of labour. A better way to reduce unemployment may be to stimulate  DEMAND  and so increase output; another is to make the labour market more flexible, not less. ']\n",

Over their lifetime, a typical person's income varies by far more than how much they spend. On  AVERAGE , young people have low incomes but big spending commitments: on investing in their  HUMAN CAPITAL  through education and training, building a family, buying a home, and so on. So they do not save much and often borrow heavily. As they get older their income generally rises, they pay off their mortgage, the children leave home and they prepare for retirement, so they sharply increase their saving and  INVESTMENT . In retirement, their income is largely or entirely from state benefits and the saving and investment they did when working; they spend most or all of their income, and, by selling off  ASSETS , often spend more than their income.\\n Broadly speaking, this theory is supported by the data, though some economists argue that young people do not spend as much as they should on, say, being educated, because lenders are reluctant to extend  CREDIT  to them. One puzzle is that people often have substantial assets left when they die.

Public  FINANCIAL MARKETS  try to maximise the liquidity of assets such as  BONDS  and  EQUITIES  by providing a central meeting place (the exchange) in which would-be buyers and sellers can easily find each other. Financial market makers (middlemen such as investment  BANKS ) can also increase liquidity by using some of their  CAPITAL  to buy  SECURITIES  from those who want to sell, when there is no other buyer offering a decent  PRICE . They do this in the expectation that if they hold the asset for a while they will be able to find somebody to buy it. Typically, the higher the volume of trades happening in a marketplace, the greater is its liquidity. Moreover, highly liquid markets attract more liquidity-seeking traders, further increasing liquidity. In a similar way, there can be vicious cycles in which liquidity dries up.

It is now a substantial branch of economics and has had an impact beyond the ivory towers.\\n The \"economics\" of law and economics is firmly in the  LIBERAL ECONOMICS  camp, favouring free markets and arguing that  REGULATION  often does more harm than good. It stresses the economic value of having clear, enforceable  PROPERTY RIGHTS , and of ensuring that these can be bought and sold. It has encouraged many  ANTITRUST  policy\\xadmakers to focus on maximising consumer  WELFARE , rather than, say, protecting small  FIRMS  or opposing big ones just because they are big. It has also ventured into broader sociological issues, for instance, analysing the economic causes of criminality and how to structure legal incentives to reduce crime.

Also known as cyclical \\xadindicators, these are groups of statistics that point to the future direction of the economy and the  BUSINESS CYCLE . Certain economic variables, fairly consistently, precede changes in  GDP  and certain others precede changes in  INFLATION . In some countries, statisticians combine the various different leading indicators into an overall leading index of economic  GROWTH  or inflation. However, there is not necessarily any causal relationship between the leading indicators and what they are predicting, which is why, like other crystal balls, they are fallible.

      "['L', 'Life', \"\\n     Human life is priceless. But this has not stopped economists trying to put a financial value on it. One reason is to help  FIRMS  and policymakers to make better decisions on how much to spend on costly safety measures designed to reduce the loss of life. Another is to help insurers and courts judge how much compensation to pay in the event of, say, a fatal accident.\\n One way to value a life is to calculate a person's  HUMAN CAPITAL  by working out how much he or she would earn were they to survive to a ripe old age. This could result in very different sums being paid to victims of the same accident. After an air crash, probably more  MONEY  would go to the family of a first-class passenger than to that of someone flying economy. This may not seem fair. Nor would using this method to decide what to spend on safety measures, as it would mean much higher expenditure on avoiding the death of, say, an investment banker than on saving the life of a teacher or coal miner. It would also imply spending more on safety measures for young people and being positively reckless with the lives of retired people.\\n Another approach is to analyse the risks that people are voluntarily willing to take, and how much they require to be paid for taking them. Taking into account differences in  WAGES  for high death-risk and low death-risk jobs, and allowing for differences in education, experience, and so on, it is possible to calculate roughly what value people put on their own lives. In industrialised countries, most studies using this method come up with a value of $5m-10m. \"]\n",

His two best-known works were the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 with Friedrich Engels, and Das Kapital, in four volumes published between 1867 and 1910. Most of his economic assumptions were drawn from orthodox  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS , but he used them to reach highly unorthodox conclusions. Although claimed and blamed as the inspiration of some of the most virulently anti-market governments the world has ever seen, he was not wholly against  CAPITALISM . Indeed, he praised it for rescuing millions of people from “the idiocy of rural life”. Even so, he thought it was doomed. A shortage of  DEMAND  would concentrate economic power and wealth in ever fewer hands, producing an ever-larger and more miserable proletariat. This would eventually rise up, creating a “dictatorship of the proletariat” and leading eventually to a “withering away” of the state. Marx thought that this version of history was inevitable. So far, history has proved him wrong, largely because capitalism has delivered a much better deal to the masses than he believed it would. ']\n",

Modern portfolio theory is based upon the simple idea that  DIVERSIFICATION  can produce the same  TOTAL RETURNS  for less  RISK . Combining many financial  ASSETS  in a portfolio is less risky than putting all your investment eggs in one basket. The theory has four basic premises. Investors are  RISK AVERSE .  SECURITIES  are traded in efficient markets. Risk should be analysed in terms of an investor's overall portfolio, rather than by looking at individual assets.  For every level of risk, there is an optimal portfolio of assets that will have the highest  EXPECTED RETURNS .   All of this seems comparatively straightforward now, except perhaps the bit about efficient markets. But it was shocking when it was put forward in the early 1950s by Harry Markowitz, who later won the Nobel prize for it. According to Mr Markowitz, when he explained his theory to the high priests of the  CHICAGO SCHOOL , ' MILTON FRIEDMAN  argued that portfolio theory was not economics'. It is now.

Mercantilists feared that  MONEY  would become too scarce to sustain high levels of  OUTPUT  and employment; their favoured solution was cheap money (low  INTEREST  rates). In a forerunner to the 20th-century debate between KEYNESIANS and MONETARISTS, they were opposed by advocates of  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS , who argued that cheap and plentiful money could result in  INFLATION . The original mercantilists, such as John Law, a Scots financier (and convicted murderer), believed that a country's economic prosperity and political power came from its stocks of precious metals. To maximise these stocks they argued against  FREE TRADE , favouring protectionist policies designed to minimise  IMPORTS  and maximise  EXPORTS , creating a  TRADE SURPLUS  that could be used to acquire more precious metal. This was contested for the classicists by  ADAM SMITH  and David Hume, who argued that a country's wealth came not from its stock of precious metals but rather from its stocks of productive resources ( LAND ,  LABOUR ,  CAPITAL , and so on) and how efficiently they are used. Free trade increased  EFFICIENCY  by allowing countries to specialise in things in which they have a  COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE . \"]\n",

In his best-known work, Principles of Economics, he retained the emphasis on the importance of costs, which was standard in  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS . But he added to it, helping to create  NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS , by explaining that the  OUTPUT  and  PRICE  of a product are determined by both  SUPPLY  and  DEMAND , and that  MARGINAL  costs and benefits are crucial. He was the first economist to explain that demand falls as price increases, and that therefore the  DEMAND CURVE  slopes downwards from left to right.

Microeconomics considers issues such as how households reach decisions about  CONSUMPTION  and  SAVING , how  FIRMS  set a  PRICE  for their  OUTPUT , whether  PRIVATISATION  improves  EFFICIENCY , whether a particular market has enough  COMPETITION  in it and how the market for  LABOUR  works.

Contrast with  PERFECT COMPETITION , in which no single firm can affect the price of what it produces. Typically, a monopoly will produce less, at a higher price, than would be the case for the entire market under perfect competition. It decides its price by calculating the quantity of output at which its  MARGINAL  revenue would equal its marginal cost, and then sets whatever price would enable it to sell exactly that quantity.\\n In practice, few monopolies are absolute, and their power to set prices or limit  SUPPLY  is constrained by some actual or potential near-competitors (see MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION). An extreme case of this occurs when a single firm dominates a market but has no pricing power because it is in  a  CONTESTABLE MARKET ; that is if it does not operate efficiently, a more efficient rival firm will take its entire market away.  ANTITRUST  policy can curb monopoly power by encouraging  COMPETITION  or, when there is a  NATURAL MONOPOLY  and thus competition would be inefficient, through  REGULATION  of prices.

North America gave around 1% of its  GDP  in total between 1948 and 1952; most of it came from the United States and the rest from Canada. The Americans left it to the Europeans to work out the details on allocating aid, which may be why, according to most economic analyses, it achieved more success than latter day aid programmes in which most of the decisions on how the  MONEY  is spent are made by the donors. The main institution through which aid was administered was the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which in 1961 became the  OECD .

      "['M', 'Multiplier', '\\n     Shorthand for the way in which a change in spending produces an even larger change in  INCOME . For instance, suppose a  GOVERNMENT  loosens  FISCAL POLICY , increasing net  PUBLIC SPENDING  by pumping an extra $10 billion into education. This has an immediate effect by increasing the income of teachers and of people who sell educational supplies or build or maintain schools. These people will in turn spend some of their extra money, putting more cash into the pockets of others, who spend some of it, and so on.  In theory, this process could continue indefinitely, in which case the multiplier would have an infinite value. In practice, most people save some of their extra income rather than spend it. How much they spend will depend on their  MARGINAL  \\t\\t\\t PROPENSITY  to consume. The value of the multiplier can be calculated by this formula:  multiplier = 1 / (1 - marginal propensity to consume) If the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5 (50 cents of an extra dollar), the multiplier is 2.

MILTON FRIEDMAN  argued that economic models should not be judged on the basis of the validity of their assumptions, but on the accuracy of their predictions. An expert billiards player, he said, may not know the laws of physics, but acts as if he knows such laws. So his behaviour could be predicted accurately with a model that assumes he knows the laws of physics. Likewise, the behaviour of people making economic decisions may be accurately predicted by a model that assumes their goal is, say,  PROFIT MAXIMISATION , even if they are not actually conscious of this being their goal. The more complex the thing being modelled, the harder it is to get right. Economic  FORECASTING  has a poor overall track record.

Such menu costs mean that firms may be reluctant to change their prices every time there is a shift in the balance of  SUPPLY  and  DEMAND , so there will be  STICKY PRICES  and the market for their  OUTPUT  will be in  DISEQUILIBRIUM .

The fact that unemployment and inflation often rise sharply, and that growth often slows or  GDP  falls, may be evidence of poorly executed macro\\xadeconomic policy.

A farmer who exchanges fruit for money can spend that money in the future; if he holds on to his fruit it might rot and no longer be useful for paying for something.  INFLATION  undermines the usefulness of money as a store of value, in particular, and also as a unit of account for comparing values at different points in time.

Contrast with  MICROECONOMICS , the study of the behaviour of individual markets, workers, households and  FIRMS . Although economists generally separate themselves into distinct macro and micro camps, macroeconomic phenomena are the product of all the microeconomic activity in an economy.

Most industrial countries have a minimum wage, although certain sorts of workers are often exempted, such as young people or part-timers. Most economists reckon that a minimum wage, if it is doing what it is meant to do, will lead to higher  UNEMPLOYMENT  than there would be without it. The main justification offered by politicians for having a minimum wage is that the wage that would be decided by buyers and sellers in a free market would be so low that it would be immoral for people to work for it. So the minimum wage should be above the market-clearing wage, in which case fewer workers would be demanded at that wage than would be hired at the market wage. How many fewer will depend on how far the minimum wage is above the market wage.  Some economists have challenged this simple  SUPPLY  and  DEMAND  model. Several empirical studies have suggested that a minimum wage moderately above the free-market wage would not harm employment much and could (in rare circumstances) potentially raise it. These studies are not widely accepted among economists. Whatever it does for those in work, a minimum wage cannot help the majority of the very poorest people in most countries, who typically have no job in which to earn a minimum wage. ']\n",

A school of economic thought that developed in opposition to post-1945  KEYNESIAN  policies of  DEMAND  management, echoing earlier debates between  MERCANTILISM  and  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS . Monetarism is based on the belief that  INFLATION  has its roots in the  GOVERNMENT  printing too much  MONEY . It is closely associated with Milton MILTON FRIEDMAN, who argued, based on the  QUANTITY THEORY OF MONEY , that government should keep the  MONEY SUPPLY  fairly steady, expanding it slightly each year mainly to allow for the natural  GROWTH  of the economy. If it did this,  MARKET FORCES  would efficiently solve the problems of  INFLATION ,  UNEMPLOYMENT  and  RECESSION . Monetarism had its heyday in the early 1980s,  when economists, governments and investors pounced eagerly on every new money-supply statistic, particularly in the United States and the UK.  Many  CENTRAL BANKS  had set formal targets for money-supply growth, so every wiggle in the data was scrutinised for clues to the next move in the rate of  INTEREST . Since then, the notion that faster money-supply growth automatically causes higher inflation has fallen out of favour. The money supply is useful as a policy target only if the relationship between money and nominal  GDP , and hence inflation, is stable and predictable. The way the money supply affects  PRICES  and  OUTPUT  depends on how fast it circulates through the economy. The trouble is that its  VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION  can suddenly change. During the 1980s, the link between different measures of the money supply and inflation proved to be less clear than monetarist theories had suggested, and most central banks stopped setting binding monetary targets. Instead, many have adopted explicit inflation targets. ']\n",

Apart from continental drift,  LAND  is immobile.  CAPITAL  has long been extremely mobile within countries, and, with the rise of  GLOBALISATION , it is now able to move easily around the world.  ENTERPRISE  is mobile, although to what extent depends on the particular  ENTREPRENEUR . Some members of the  LABOUR  market zoom around the world to work; others will not move to the next town.\\n CAPITAL CONTROLS  are the main obstacle to capital mobility, and these have been mostly removed or reduced since 1980. The sources of labour immobility are more numerous and complex, including immigration controls, transport costs, language barriers and a reluctance to move away from family or friends. Workers are far more mobile within the United States than they are within the  EUROPEAN UNION  or within individual EU countries. Some economists reckon that the willingness of workers to move to where the work is helps to explain the stronger economic performance and lower  UNEMPLOYMENT  of the United States.\\n Can you sometimes have too much mobility? Certainly, some  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  have suffered from  HOT MONEY  rushing into and then out of their markets.\\n In general, the possibility that a factor of production may suddenly move elsewhere can create serious economic problems. For instance, an employer may think twice about investing in training an employee if it fears that the employee may suddenly take a job with another firm. Similarly, entrepreneurs are unlikely to take the  RISK  of pursuing a new idea if they fear that their capital may disappear at any moment, hence the importance of having access to long-term capital, such as by issuing  BONDS  and  EQUITIES . \"]\n",

The  WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION  requires member countries to accord the most favourable tariff and regulatory treatment given to the product of any one member to the 'like products' of all other members. Before the general agreement on tariffs and trade, there was often a most-favoured nation clause in bilateral trade agreements, which helped the world move towards  FREE TRADE . In the 1930s, however, there was a backlash against this, and most-favoured nations were treated less favourably. This shift pushed the world economy towards division into regional  TRADE AREAS .

There are three sorts of mergers between  FIRMS :  HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION , in which two similar firms tie the knot;  VERTICAL INTEGRATION , in which two firms at different stages in the  SUPPLY  chain get together; and  DIVERSIFICATION , when two companies with nothing in common jump into bed. These can be a voluntary marriage of equals; a voluntary takeover of one firm by another; or a hostile takeover, in which the management of the target firm resists the advances of the buyer but is eventually forced to accept a deal by its current owners. For reasons that are not at all clear, merger activity generally happens in waves. One possible explanation is that when  SHARE  \\t\\t\\t PRICES  are low, many firms have a  MARKET CAPITALISATION  that is low relative to the value of their  ASSETS . This makes them attractive to buyers (see  TOBIN ). In theory, the different sorts of mergers have different sorts of potential benefits. However, the damning lesson of merger waves stretching back over the past 50 years is that, with one big ex ception - the spate of  LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS  in the United States during the 1980s - they have often failed to deliver benefits that justify the costs.

CENTRAL BANKS  aim to manage  DEMAND  by controlling the  SUPPLY  of money through  OPEN-MARKET OPERATIONS ,  RESERVE REQUIREMENTS  and changing the rate of  INTEREST  (to be exact, the  DISCOUNT RATE ).\\n One difficulty for policymakers lies in how to measure the relevant money supply. There are several different methods, reflecting the different  LIQUIDITY  of various sorts of  MONEY .

If the  CENTRAL BANK  doubles the money supply, the  PRICE  level will double too. Twice as many dollars means half as much bang for the buck. This theory, a core belief of  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS , was first put forward in the 18th century by David Hume. He set out the classical dichotomy that economic variables come in two varieties, nominal and real, and that the things that influence nominal variables do not necessarily affect the real economy. Today few economists think that pure monetary neutrality exists in the real world, at least in the short run. Inflation does affect the real economy because, for instance, there may be  STICKY PRICES  or  MONEY ILLUSION . ']\n",

Money illusion, a phrase coined by KEYNES, is used by some economists to argue that a small amount of inflation may not be a bad thing  and could even be beneficial, helping to “grease the wheels” of the economy. Because of money illusion, workers like to see their nominal  WAGES  rise, giving them the illusion that their circumstances are improving, even though in real (inflation-adjusted) terms they may be no better off.

      "['M', 'Marginal', \"\\n     The difference made by one extra unit of something. Marginal revenue is the extra revenue earned by selling one more unit of something. The marginal  PRICE  is how much extra a consumer must pay to buy one extra unit. Marginal  UTILITY  is how much extra utility a person gets from consuming (or doing) an extra unit of something. The marginal product of  LABOUR  is how much extra  OUTPUT  a firm would get by employing an extra worker, or by getting an existing worker to put in an extra hour on the job. The marginal  PROPENSITY  to consume (or to save) measures by how much a household's  CONSUMPTION  ( SAVINGS ) would increase if its  INCOME  rose by, say, $1. The marginal tax rate measures how much extra tax you would have to pay if you earned an extra dollar.  The marginal cost (or whatever) can be very different from the  AVERAGE  cost (or whatever), which simply divides total costs (or whatever) by the total number of units produced (or whatever). A common finding in  MICROECONOMICS  is that small incremental changes can matter enormously. In general, thinking 'at the margin' often leads to better economic decision making than thinking about the averages.  ALFRED MARSHALL , the father of  NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS , based many of his theories of economic behaviour on marginal rather than average behaviour. For instance, given certain plausible assumptions, a profit-maximising firm will increase production up to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This is because if marginal revenue exceeded marginal cost, the firm could increase its  PROFIT  by producing an extra unit of output. Alternatively, if marginal cost exceeded marginal revenue, the firm could increase its profit by producing fewer units of output.\\n In all walks of life, a basic rule of rational economic decision making is: do something only if the marginal utility you get from it exceeds the marginal cost of doing it. \"]\n",
      "['M', 'Monopolistic competition', '\\n     Somewhere between  PERFECT COMPETITION  and  MONOPOLY , also known as imperfect competition. It describes many real-world markets. Perfectly competitive markets are extremely rare, and few  FIRMS  enjoy a pure monopoly;  OLIGOPOLY  is more common. In monopolistic competition, there are fewer firms than in a perfectly competitive market and each can differentiate its products from the rest somewhat, perhaps by  ADVERTISING  or through small differences in design. These small differences form  BARRIERS TO ENTRY . As a result, firms can earn some excess profits, although not as much as a pure monopoly, without a new entrant being able to reduce  PRICES  through  COMPETITION . Prices are higher and  OUTPUT  lower than under perfect competition. ']\n",
      "['N', 'Net present value', '\\n     A measure used to help decide whether or not to proceed with an  INVESTMENT . Net means that both the costs and benefits of the investment are in cluded. To calculate net present value (NPV), first add together all the expected benefits from the investment, now and in the future. Then add together all the expected costs. Then work out what these future benefits and costs are worth now by adjusting future cashflow using an appropriate  DISCOUNT RATE . Then subtract the costs from the benefits. If the NPV is negative, then the investment cannot be justified by the  EXPECTED RETURNS . If the NPV is positive, it can, although it pays to make comparisons with the NPVs of alternative investment opportunities before going ahead. ']\n",
      "['N', 'NGO', \"\\n     Short for non-government organisation. Although such groups have existed for generations (in the early 1800s, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society played a powerful part in abolishing slavery laws), recent social and economic shifts have given these typically voluntary, non-profit, 'issue-driven' organisations new life. The collapse of  COMMUNISM , the spread of democracy, technological change and economic integration ( GLOBALISATION , in short) have each helped NGOs grow. Globalisation itself has exacerbated a host of worries about the environment,  LABOUR  rights, human rights, consumer rights, and so on. Democratisation and technological progress have revolutionised the way in which citizens can unite to express their disquiet.  Governments have been at the sharp end of pressure from NGOs. Arguably, however, it is inter-governmental institutions such as the  WORLD BANK , the  IMF , the UN agencies and the  WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION  (WTO) that have felt it more, owing to their lack of political leverage. Few parliamentarians will face direct pressure from the IMF or the WTO, but every policymaker faces pressure from citizens' groups with special interests. Add to this the poor public image that these technocratic, faceless bureaucracies have developed, and it is hardly surprising that they are popular targets for NGO 'swarms'. How governments and inter-governmental organisations respond to NGOs could have huge implications, including for the world's economies. Equally important will be how NGOs themselves respond to greater scrutiny and to growing concern about how accountable they are, and to whom. \"]\n",

The formation of this regional  TRADE AREA  was opposed by many politicians in all three countries. In the United States and Canada, in particular, there were fears that NAFTA would result in domestic job losses to cheaper locations in Mexico.

      "['N', 'Natural rate of unemployment', \"\\n     A controversial phrase, which actually means little more than the lowest rate of  UNEMPLOYMENT  at which the jobs market can be in stable  EQUILIBRIUM . Keynesians, encouraged by the  PHILLIPS CURVE , assumed that a  GOVERNMENT  could lower the rate of unemployment if it was willing to accept a little more  INFLATION . However, economists such as  MILTON FRIEDMAN  argued that this supposed inflation-for-jobs trade-off was in fact a trap. Governments that tolerated higher inflation in the hope of lowering unemployment would find that joblessness dipped only briefly before returning to its previous level, while inflation would rise and stay high. Instead, they argued, unemployment has an equilibrium or natural rate, determined not by the amount of  DEMAND  in an economy but by the structure of the  LABOUR  market. This is the lowest level of unemployment at which inflation will remain stable. When unemployment is above the natural rate demand can potentially be increased to bring it to the natural rate, but attempting to lower it even further will only cause inflation to accelerate. Hence the natural rate is also known as the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment, or  NAIRU .  At first, the NAIRU became synonymous with the view that  MACROECONOMIC POLICY  could not conquer unemployment. It was often used to justify policy inaction even when unemployment rose to more than 10% of workers in industrialised countries during the 1980s and 1990s, even though economists' estimates of the NAIRU differed hugely. More recently, economists looking for ways to reduce unemployment have started to ask whether, and under what circumstances, the natural rate might change. Most solutions have stressed the need to make more people employable at the prevailing level of  WAGES , in particular by increasing  LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY . Econ\\xadomists still disagree over what jobless rate at any particular point in time is the NAIRU, but nobody any longer thinks that the natural rate is fixed. Indeed, some think the concept has no meaning at all. \"]\n",
      "['N', 'New trade theory', \"\\n     Although most economists support  FREE TRADE , in the 1970s a growing number of them became increasingly puzzled by the large differences between the predictions of free trade theory and real-world trade flows. Their solution to this puzzle is known as new trade theory.  One mystery was that trade was growing fastest between industrial countries with similar economies and endowments of the  FACTORS OF PRODUCTION . In many new industries, there was no clear  COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE  for any country. Patterns of production and trade often seemed matters of chance. Trade between two countries would often consist mostly of similar goods, for example, one country would sell cars to another country from which it would import different models of cars.  One explanation, associated in particular with Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drew on  ADAM SMITH 's idea that the  DIVISION OF LABOUR  lowers unit costs.  ECONOMIES OF SCALE  within firms are incompatible with the  PERFECT COMPETITION  assumed by traditional trade theory. A more realistic assumption is that many markets have  MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION . When a monopolistically competitive market expands, it does so through a mixture of more firms (greater product variety) and bigger firms, with bigger-scale economies. Free trade expands market size beyond national borders and so allows firms to  reap bigger economies of scale, to the benefit of consumers, workers and shareholders.  The upside may be greater the more similar are the trading economies. This may explain why trade  LIBERALISATION  is easier to achieve between similar countries. Thus, for example, the free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada produced only minor local complaints, whereas its subsequent expansion to include the very different economy of Mexico was much more controversial (see  NAFTA ). \"]\n",

Still, the title of Nobel laureate and the $1m award stumped up each year by Sweden’s  CENTRAL BANK  make it worth winning.

      "['N', 'Network effect', '\\n     When the value of a good to a consumer changes because the number of people using it changes. For instance, owning a phone becomes more valuable as more people are plugged into the telephone network. Network effects are sometimes called network EXTERNALITY, although this implies, often wrongly, that the benefits from being part of a network are a sort of  MARKET FAILURE . They give a huge  COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE  to the firm that owns the network. This  INCUMBENT ADVANTAGE  arises because a new entrant must persuade people to join a network that starts with fewer members, and thus may be less valuable to them than the network they are currently in. This is why markets for products with network effects are often dominated by only a few firms or a single  MONOPOLY . Some economists argue that many recent technological innovations, notably the Internet, have large positive network effects, which make possible much higher  PRODUCTIVITY  and growth than in the past. ']\n",
      "['N', 'Natural monopoly', '\\n     When a  MONOPOLY  occurs because it is more efficient for one firm to serve an entire market than for two or more  FIRMS  to do so, because of the sort of  ECONOMIES OF SCALE  available in that market. A common example is water distribution, in which the main cost is laying a network of pipes to deliver water. One firm can do the job at a lower  AVERAGE  cost per customer than two firms with competing networks of pipes. Monopolies can arise unnaturally by a firm acquiring sole ownership of a resource that is essential to the production of a good or service, or by a  government granting a firm the legal right to be the sole producer. Other unnatural monopolies occur when a firm is much more efficient than its rivals for reasons other than economies of scale. Unlike some other sorts of monopoly, natural monopolies have little chance of being driven out of a market by more efficient new entrants. Thus  REGULATION  of natural monopolies may be needed to protect their captive consumers. ']\n",

Neo-classical thinking, which mostly assumes that markets tend towards  EQUILIBRIUM , was attacked by  KEYNES  and became unfashionable during the Keynesian-dominated decades after the second world war.

Because it takes place automatically through the tax system, it may attach less stigma to the receipt of financial help than some other forms of  WELFARE  assistance.

The amount of public ownership in different countries has always varied considerably. Nationalisation has taken place for various reasons, ranging from socialist ideology to attempts to remedy examples of  MARKET FAILURE .\\n The performance of nationalised firms has often, but not always, been poor compared with their private-sector counterparts. State-owned businesses often enjoy a legally protected  MONOPOLY , and the lack of  COMPETITION  means the firms face little pressure to be efficient. Politicians often interfere in important management decisions, making it harder to take unpopular actions on pay, factory closures and job cuts, particularly when there are strong public-sector trade  UNIONS  and a union-friendly government.

      "['O', 'Optimal currency area', '\\n     A geographical area within which it would pay to have a single currency. An optimal currency area can come in many sizes. Some may span several countries and others may be smaller than an individual country. The benefits of having one currency are lower foreign exchange and currency HEDGING costs and more transparent pricing (because every  PRICE  is expressed in the same currency). But unless the single currency is used within an optimal currency area, these benefits may be dwarfed by the costs. A single currency means a single  MONETARY POLICY   and no opportunity for one part of the currency area to change its  EXCHANGE RATE  with the other parts. This can be a big problem if a country or region is likely to suffer from ASYMMETRIC SHOCKS that affect it differently from the rest of the single-currency area, because it will no longer be able to respond by loosening its national monetary policy or devaluing its currency. This may not be an insuperable problem if workers in the affected country are able and willing to move freely to other countries; if  WAGES  and prices are flexible and can adjust to the shock; or if  FISCAL POLICY  can shift resources to areas hurt by a shock from areas that are not hurt. For a currency area to be optimal, ideally asymmetric shocks should be rare, implying that the economies involved are on similar BUSINESS CYCLES and have similar structures. Moreover, the single monetary policy should affect all the constituent parts in the same way (an  INTEREST  \\t\\t\\tRATE cut should not, say, reduce  UNEMPLOYMENT  in one part and increase  INFLATION  in another). There should be no cultural, linguistic or legal barriers to  LABOUR  mobility across frontiers; there should be wage flexibility; and there should be some system for transferring resources to regions that are suffering. In practice, few of the parts of the world that have a single currency are optimal currency areas, probably including the  EURO ZONE , although having a single currency often makes them become gradually more alike and thus more optimal.

A lot of productive  CAPITAL  equipment that had been viable at lower oil prices proved to be unprofitable to run at the higher prices and was shut down.

Eventually, as investors become better informed, the price usually returns to a more appropriate level.

Each country made specific promises on economic policy: the United States pledged to cut the federal  deficit , Japan promised a looser [economics-term KEY-\"MONETARY POLICY\"]monetary policy[/economics-term] and a range of financial-sector reforms, and Germany proposed tax cuts. All countries agreed to intervene in currency markets as necessary to get the dollar down. Perhaps not surprisingly, not all the promises were kept (least of all the American one on deficit cutting), but even so the plan turned out to be spectacularly successful. By the end of 1987, the dollar had fallen by 54% against both the D-mark and the yen from its peak in February 1985. This sharp drop led to a new fear: of an uncontrolled dollar plunge. So in 1987 another big international plan, the Louvre Accord, was hatched to stabilise the dollar. Again specific policy pledges were made (the United States to tighten  fiscal policy , Japan to loosen monetary policy). Again the participants promised currency intervention if major currencies moved outside an agreed, but unpublished, set of ranges. The dollar promptly rose. ']\n",
      "['P', 'Probability', '\\n     How likely something is to happen, usually expressed as the ratio of the number of ways the outcome may occur to the number of total possible outcomes for the event. For instance, each time you throw a dice there are six possible outcomes, but in only one of these can a six come up. Thus the probability of throwing a six on any given throw is one in six.

Where there is a  MONOPOLY , or firms have some  MARKET POWER , the seller has some control over the price, which will probably be higher than in a perfectly competitive market. By how much more will depend on how much market power there is, and on whether the firm(s) with the market power are committed to  PROFIT MAXIMISATION .

The gains have been greatest when  services  have been allocated to private firms through competitive bidding. They have been smallest, and arguably even negative, in cases when the main contribution of the private firm has been to raise finance.

By necessity, the quantity of these goods is somewhat fixed, because to increase  SUPPLY  too much would mean that they were no longer positional. What would owning a Rolls-Royce say about you if everybody owned one? Fears that the rise of positional goods would limit  GROWTH , since by definition they had to be in scarce supply, have so far proved misplaced.

It is so competitive that any individual buyer or seller has a negligible impact on the market  PRICE . Products are homogeneous.  INFORMATION  is perfect. Everybody is a price taker.  FIRMS  earn only normal  PROFIT , the bare minimum profit necessary to keep them in business. If firms earn more than that (excess profits) the absence of barriers to entry means that other firms will enter the market and drive the price level down until there are only normal profits to be made.

Indeed, even small, apparently trivial, differences in the path you have taken can have huge consequences for where you are and can go. In  ECONOMICS , path dependence refers to the way in which apparently insignificant events and choices can have huge consequences for the development of a market or an economy.\\n Economists disagree over how widespread path dependence is, and whether it is a form of  MARKET FAILURE . One focus of this debate is the QWERTY keyboard. Some argue that the QWERTY design was deliberately made slow to use so as to overcome a jamming-at-speed problem in early typewriters. Much faster alternative layouts of keys have failed to prosper, even though the anti-jamming rationale for QWERTY has been defunct for years. Others say that the QWERTY system is as efficient a layout of keys as any other and that its success is a triumph of  MARKET FORCES .

If the amount of inputs needed to produce one more unit of output is less than was needed to produce the last unit of output, then the firm is enjoying increasing  RETURNS  to scale (or increasing  MARGINAL  product). If each extra unit of output requires a growing amount of inputs to produce it, the firm faces diminishing returns to scale (diminishing marginal product). ']\n",

In reality, change often produces losers as well as winners. Pareto efficiency does not help judge whether this sort of change is economically good or bad. ']\n",
      "['P', 'Price elasticity', '\\n     A measure of the responsiveness of  DEMAND  to a change in  PRICE . If demand changes by more than the price has changed, the good is price-elastic.

They are:\\n non-rival - one person consuming them does not stop another person consuming them;\\n non-excludable - if one person can consume them, it is impossible to stop another person consuming them;\\n non-rejectable - people cannot choose not to consume them even if they want to.\\n Examples include clean air, a national defence system and the judiciary. The combination of non-rivalry and non-excludability means that it can be hard to get people to pay to consume them, so they might not be provided at all if left to  MARKET FORCES . Thus public goods are regarded as an example of  MARKET FAILURE , and in most countries they are provided at least in part by  GOVERNMENT  and paid for through compulsory  TAXATION .

In each case, it is important to distinguish between the  AVERAGE  propensity and the  MARGINAL  one. The average propensity to consume is simply total  CONSUMPTION  divided by total  INCOME . The marginal propensity to consume measures how much of each extra dollar of income is consumed: the percentage change in consumption divided by the percentage change in income. The value of the marginal propensity to consume, which determines the  MULTIPLIER , is harder to predict than the value of the average propensity to consume. ']\n",

The predator charges so little that it may sustain losses over a period of time, in the hope that its rivals will be driven out of business. Clearly, this strategy makes sense only if the predatory firm is able eventually to establish a  MONOPOLY . Some advocates of anti- DUMPING  policies say that cheap  IMPORTS  are examples of predatory pricing. In practice, the evidence gives little support for this view. Indeed, in general, predatory pricing is quite rare.

Put simply, profit is a firm's total revenue minus total cost.\\n Economists distinguish between normal profit and excess profit. Normal profit is the opportunity cost of the  ENTREPRENEUR , the amount of profit just sufficient to keep the firm in business. If profit is any lower than that, then enterprise would be better off engaged in some alternative economic activity. Excess profit, also known as super-normal profit, is profit above normal profit and is usually evidence that the firm enjoys some  MARKET POWER  that allows it to be more  profitable than it would be in a market with  PERFECT COMPETITION . \"]\n",

      "['P', 'Property rights', \"\\n     Essential to any market economy. To trade, it is essential to know that the person selling a good or service owns it and that ownership will pass to the buyer. The stronger and clearer property rights are, the more likely it is that trade will take place and that  PRICES  will be efficient. If there are no property rights over something there can be severe consequences. A solution to the costly  EXTERNALITY  of clean air being polluted may be to establish property rights over the air, so that the owner can charge the polluter to pump smoke into the atmosphere.\\n Private property rights are often more economically efficient than common ownership. When people do not own something directly, they may have little incentive to look after it. (See the  TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS .) Strikingly, in Russia after  COMMUNISM , the establishment of a well-functioning market economy proved difficult, partly because it was unclear who owned many of the country's resources, and those property rights that did exist often counted for little. Businesses would often have their products stolen by criminal gangs or be forced to hand over most of their profits in protection money. It is no coincidence that an effective judicial system, as well as property rights for it to enforce, is a feature of all advanced market economies.\\n That said, nowhere are property rights absolute. For instance,  TAXATION  is a clear example of the state infringing taxpayers' ownership of their money. The economic cost of infringing property rights underlines how important it is that governments think carefully about the consequences for economic  GROWTH  of their tax policies. \"]\n",

      "['P', 'Poverty', '\\n     The state of being poor, which depends on how you define it. One approach is to use some absolute measure. For instance, the poverty rate refers to the number of households whose  INCOME  is less than three times what is needed to provide an adequate diet. (Though what constitutes adequate may change over time.) Another is to measure relative poverty. For instance, the number of people in poverty can be defined as all households with an income of less than, say, half the  AVERAGE  household income. Or the (relative) poverty line may be defined as the level of income below  which are, say, the poorest 10% of households. In each case, the dividing line between poverty and not-quite poverty is somewhat arbitrary.\\n As countries get richer, the number of people in absolute poverty usually gets smaller. This is not necessarily true of the numbers in relative poverty. The way that relative poverty is defined means that it is always likely to identify a large number of impoverished households. However rich a country becomes, there will always be 10% of households poorer than the rest, even though they may live in mansions and eat caviar (albeit smaller mansions and less caviar than the other 90% of households).

      "['P', 'Privatisation', \"\\n     Selling state-owned businesses to private investors. This policy was associated initially with Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, which privatised numerous companies, including  PUBLIC UTILITY  businesses such as British Telecom, British Gas, and electricity and water companies. During the 1990s, privatisation became a favourite policy of governments all over the world.\\n There were several reasons for the popularity of privatisation. In some instances, the aim was to improve the performance of publicly owned companies. Often  NATIONALISATION  had failed to achieve its goals and had become increasingly associated with poor service to customers. Sometimes privatisation was part of transforming a state-owned  MONOPOLY  into a competitive market, by combining ownership transfer with  DEREGULATION  and  LIBERALISATION . Sometimes privatisation  offered a way to raise new  CAPITAL  for the firm to invest in improving its service,  MONEY  that was not available in the public sector because of constraints on  PUBLIC SPENDING . Indeed, perhaps the main attraction of privatisation to many politicians was that the proceeds from it could ease the pressure on the public purse. As a result, they could avoid (in the short-term) doing the more painful things necessary to improve the fiscal position, such as raising taxes or cutting public spending. \"]\n",
      "['P', 'Productivity', \"\\n     The relationship between inputs and  OUTPUT , which can be applied to individual  FACTORS OF PRODUCTION  or collectively.  LABOUR  productivity is the most widely used measure and is usually calculated by dividing total output by the number of workers or the number of hours worked. Total factor productivity attempts to measure the overall productivity of the inputs used by a firm or a country.\\n Alas, the usefulness of productivity statistics is questionable. The quality of different inputs can change significantly over time. There can also be significant differences in the mix of inputs. Furthermore, firms and countries may use different definitions of their inputs, especially  CAPITAL .\\n That said, much of the difference in countries' living standards reflects differences in their productivity. Usually, the higher productivity is the better, but this is not always so. In the UK during the 1980s, labour productivity rose sharply, leading some economists to talk of a 'productivity miracle'. Others disagreed, saying that productivity had risen because unemployment had risen - in other words, the least productive workers had been removed from the figures on which the  AVERAGE  was calculated.  There was a similar debate in the United States starting in the late 1990s. Initially, economists doubted that a productivity miracle was taking place. But by 2003, they conceded that during the previous five years the United States enjoyed the fastest productivity growth in any such period since the second world war. Over the whole period from 1995, labour productivity growth averaged almost 3% a year, twice the average rate over the previous two decades. That did not stop economists debating why the miracle had occurred. \"]\n",
      "['P', 'Phillips curve', '\\n     In 1958, an economist from New Zealand, A.W.H. Phillips (1914-75), proposed that there was a trade-off between  INFLATION  and  UNEMPLOYMENT : the lower the unemployment rate, the higher was the rate of inflation. Governments simply had to choose the right balance between the two evils. He drew this conclusion by studying nominal wage rates and jobless rates in the UK between 1861 and 1957, which seemed to show the relationship of unemployment and inflation as a smooth curve.\\n Economies did seem to work like this in the 1950s and 1960s, but then the relationship broke down. Now economists prefer to talk about the  NAIRU , the lowest rate of unemployment at which inflation does not accelerate. ']\n",
      "['P', 'Price discrimination', '\\n     When a firm charges different customers different  PRICES  for the same product. For producers, the perfect world would be one in which they could charge each customer a different price: the price that each customer would be willing to pay. This would maximise  PRODUCER SURPLUS . This cannot happen, not least because sellers do not know how much any individual would pay.\\n Yet some price discrimination is possible if an overall market can be segmented into somewhat separate markets and the  EQUILIBRIUM  price in each of these markets is different, perhaps because of differences in consumer tastes, perhaps because in some segments the firm enjoys some  MARKET POWER . But this will work only if the market segments can be kept apart. If it is possible and profitable to buy the product in a low-price segment and resell it in a high-price segment, then price discrimination will not last for long. ']\n",

The permanent income hypothesis, developed by  MILTON FRIEDMAN , says that a person's spending decisions are guided  by what they think over their lifetime will be their  AVERAGE  (also known as permanent) income. A sharp increase in short-term income will not result in an equally sharp increase in short-term  CONSUMPTION . What if somebody unexpectedly comes into money, say by winning the lottery?

      "['P', \"Prisoners' dilemma\", '\\n     A favourite example in  GAME THEORY , which shows why co-operation is difficult to achieve even when it is mutually beneficial. Two prisoners have been arrested for the same offence and are held in different cells. Each has two options: confess, or say nothing. There are three possible outcomes. One could confess and agree to testify against the other as state witness, receiving a light sentence while his fellow prisoner receives a heavy sentence. They can both say nothing and may be lucky and get light sentences or even be let off, owing to lack of firm evidence. Or they may both confess and probably get lighter individual sentences than one would have received had he said nothing and the other had testified against him. The second outcome would be the best for both prisoners. However, the  RISK  that the other might confess and turn state witness is likely to encourage both to confess, landing both with sentences that they might have avoided had they been able to co-operate in remaining silent. In an  OLIGOPOLY ,  FIRMS  often behave like these prisoners, not setting PRICES as high as they could do if they only trusted the other firms not to undercut them. As a result, they are worse off.

      "['P', 'Patents', '\\n     In 1899 the commissioner of the American Office of Patents recommended that his office be abolished because “everything that can be invented has been invented”. The fact that there has been so much  INNOVATION  during the subsequent 100 years may owe something to the existence of patents. Economists reckon that if people are going to spend the time and  MONEY  needed to think up and develop new products, they need to be fairly confident that if the idea works they will earn a decent  PROFIT . Patents help achieve this by granting the inventor a temporary  MONOPOLY  over the idea, to stop it being stolen by imitators who have not borne any of the development  RISK  and costs. Like any monopoly, patents create inefficiency because of the lack of  COMPETITION  to produce and sell the product. So economists debate how long patent protection should last.  There is also debate about which sorts of innovation require the encouragement of a potential monopoly to make them happen. Furthermore, the pace of innovation in some industries has sharply reduced the number of years during which a patent is valuable. Some economists say that this shows that patents do not play a large part in the process of innovation. ']\n",

Food is essential, but because it is provided in a competitive market, food  SUPPLY  is not usually regarded as a public utility. Because public utilities have some  MONOPOLY  power, they are typically subject to some  REGULATION  by  GOVERNMENT , such as  PRICE  controls and perhaps an obligation to provide their services to everybody, even to those who cannot afford to pay a market price (the universal service obligation).

Increases in the  MONEY SUPPLY  are the main cause of  INFLATION . This is why Milton  FRIEDMAN  claimed that 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon'.  The theory is built on the Fisher equation, MV = PT, named after Irving Fisher (1867-1947). M is the stock of money, V is the  VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION , P is the average  PRICE  level and T is the number of transactions in the economy. The equation says, simply and obviously, that the quantity of money spent equals the quantity of money used. The quantity theory, in its purest form, assumes that V and T are both constant, at least in the short-run. Thus any change in M leads directly to a change in P. In other words, increase the money supply and you simply cause inflation.  In the 1930s,  KEYNES  challenged this theory, which was orthodoxy until then. Increases in the money supply seemed to lead to a fall in the velocity of circulation and to increases in real  INCOME , contradicting the classical dichotomy (see  MONETARY NEUTRALITY ). Later, monetarists such as Friedman conceded that V could changein response to variations in M, but did so only in stable, predictable ways that did not challenge the thrust of the theory. Even so, monetarist policies did not perform well when they were applied in many countries during the 1980s, as even Friedman has since conceded. \"]\n",

A triple-A or A++ rating represents a low risk of  DEFAULT ; a C or D rating an extreme risk of, or actual, default. Debt PRICES and  YIELDS  often (but not always) reflect these ratings. A triple-A  BOND  has a low yield. High-yielding bonds, also known as junk bonds, usually have a rating that suggests a high risk of default.  A series of financial market crises from the mid-1990s onwards led to growing debate about the reliability of ratings, and whether they were slow to give warning of impending trouble. After the  Enron  debacle, which again the ratings agencies had failed to predict, some critics argued that the big three agencies had formed a cosy  oligopoly  and that encouraging more  competition  was the way to improve ratings. \"]\n",

      "['R', 'Risk', '\\n     The chance of things not turning out as expected. Risk taking lies at the heart of  CAPITALISM  and is responsible for a large part of the  GROWTH  of an economy. In general, economists assume that people are willing to be exposed to increased risks only if, on  AVERAGE , they can expect to earn higher returns than if they had less exposure to risk. How much higher these  EXPECTED RETURNS  need to be depends partly on the  PROBABILITY  of an undesirable outcome and partly on whether the risk taker is  RISK AVERSE ,  RISK NEUTRAL  or  RISK SEEKING .  During the second half of the 20th century, economists greatly improved their understanding of risk and developed theories of  RISK MANAGEMENT , which suggest when it makes sense to use  INSURANCE ,  DIVERSIFICATION  or HEDGING to change risk exposures.  In  FINANCIAL MARKETS  the most commonly used measure of risk is the volatility (or  STANDARD DEVIATION ) of the  PRICE  of, or more appropriately the  TOTAL RETURNS  on, an  ASSET . Often added to the risk profile are other statistical measures such as skewness and the possibility of extreme changes on rare occasions.

      "['R', 'Revealed preference', \"\\n     An example of a popular joke among economists: two economists see a Ferrari. 'I want one of those,' says the first. 'Obviously not,' replies the other. To get a smile out of this it is necessary (but not, alas, sufficient) to know about revealed preference. This is the notion that what you want is revealed by what you do, not by what you say. Actions speak louder than words. If the economist had really wanted a Ferrari he would have tried to buy one, if he did not own one already.  Economists have three main approaches to modelling  DEMAND  and how it will change if  PRICES  or  INCOMES  change.  The cardinal approach involves asking consumers to say how much  UTILITY  they get from consuming a particular good, aggregating this across all goods and  SERVICES , and calculating how demand would change on the assumption that people will consume the combination of things that maximises their total utility.  The ordinal approach does not require consumers to say how much utility they get in absolute terms from consuming a particular good. Instead, it asks them to indicate the relative utility they get from consuming one item compared with another,  that is, to say if they prefer one basket of goods to another, or are indifferent between them. The third approach is revealed preference. To model demand it is only necessary to be able to compare an individual's  CONSUMPTION  decisions in situations with different prices and/or incomes and to assume that consumers are consistent in their decisions over time (that is, if they prefer wine to beer in one period they will still prefer wine in the next). \"]\n",

Nobody can predict the future perfectly; but rational expectations theory assumes that, over time, unexpected events ( SHOCKS ) will cancel out each other and that on average people's expectations about the future will be accurate. This is because they form their expectations on a rational basis, using all the  INFORMATION  available to them optimally, and learn from their mistakes. This is in contrast to other theories of how people look ahead, such as  ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS , in which people base their predictions on past trends and changes in trends, and  BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS , which assumes that expectations are somewhat irrational as a result of psychological biases.  The theory of rational expectations, for which Robert Lucas won the  NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS , initially became popular with monetarists because it seemed to prove that  KEYNESIAN  policies of  DEMAND  management would fail. With rational expectations, people learn to anticipate  GOVERNMENT  policy changes and act accordingly; since macroeconomic  FINE TUNING  requires that governments be able to fool people, this implies that it is usually futile. Subsequently, this conclusion has been challenged. However, rational and near-rational expectations have become part of the mainstream of economic thought. \"]\n",

In his 1817 book, The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, he outlined a theory of distribution of output in an economy.

However, some industries and professions impose rules on their members through self-regulation.   Regulation is often introduced to tackle  MARKET FAILURE .  EXTERNALITIES  such as pollution have inspired rules limiting factory emissions. Regulations on the selling of financial products to individuals have been introduced as protection against unscrupulous financial  FIRMS  with better  INFORMATION  than their customers.  RATE OF RETURN REGULATION  and  PRICE REGULATION  have been used to combat  NATURAL MONOPOLY , sometimes instead  of  NATIONALISATION . Some regulation has been motivated by politics rather than  ECONOMICS , for instance, restrictions on the number of hours people can work or the circumstances in which an employer can dismiss employees.  Even when introduced for sound economic reasons, regulation can generate more costs than benefits. Regulated firms or individuals may face substantial compliance costs. Firms may devote substantial resources to  REGULATORY ARBITRAGE , which would leave consumers no better off. Regulation may lead to  MORAL HAZARD  if people believe that the government is keeping an eye on the behaviour of the regulated business and so do less monitoring of their own. Regulation may be badly designed and thus lock an industry into an inefficient  EQUILIBRIUM . Rigid regulation may hold back  INNOVATION . There is also the danger of  REGULATORY CAPTURE .

      "['R', 'Real options theory', \"\\n     A newish theory of how to take  INVESTMENT  decisions when the future is uncertain, which draws parallels between the real economy and the use and valuation of financial options. It is becoming increasingly fashionable at business schools and even in the boardroom.  Traditional investment theory says that when a firm evaluates a proposed project, it should calculate the project's  NET PRESENT VALUE  (NPV) and if it is positive, go ahead.  Real options theory assumes that  FIRMS  also have some choice in when to invest. In other words, the project is like an option: there is an opportunity, but not an obligation, to go ahead with it. As with financial options, the interesting question is when to exercise the option: certainly not when it is out of the money (the cost of investing exceeds the benefit). Financial options should not necessarily be exercised as soon as they are in the money (the benefit from exercising exceeds the cost). It may be better to wait until it is deep in the money (the benefit is far above the cost). Likewise, companies should not necessarily invest as soon as a project has a positive NPV. It may pay to wait.  Most firms' investment opportunities have embedded in them many managerial options. For instance, consider an oil company whose bosses think they have discovered an oil field, but they are uncertain about how much oil it contains and what the  PRICE  of oil will be once they start to pump. Option one: to buy or lease the land and explore? Option two: if they find oil, to start to pump? Whether to exercise these options will depend on the oil price and what it is likely to do in future. Because oil prices are highly volatile, it might not make sense to go ahead with production until the oil price is far above the price at which traditional investment theory would say that the NPV is positive and give the investment the green light.  Options on real  ASSETS  behave rather like financial options (a  SHARE  option, say). The similarities are such that they can, at least in theory, be valued according to the same methodology. In the case of the oil company, for instance, the cost of  LAND  corresponds to the down-payment on a call (right to buy) option, and the extra investment needed to start production to its strike price (the money that must be paid if the option is exercised). As with financial options, the longer the option lasts before it expires and the more volatile is the price of the underlying asset (in this case, oil) the more the option is worth. This is the theory. In practice, pricing financial options is often tricky, and valuing real options is harder still. \"]\n",

A soccer star may be paid $50,000 a week to play for his team when he would be willing to turn out for only $10,000, so his economic rent is $40,000 a week. In  PERFECT COMPETITION , there are no economic rents, as new  FIRMS  enter a market and compete until  PRICES  fall and all rent is eliminated.

      "['S', 'Stabilisation', '\\n     GOVERNMENT  policies intended to smooth the economic cycle, expanding  DEMAND  when  UNEMPLOYMENT  is high and reducing it when  INFLATION  threatens to increase. Doing this by  FINE TUNING  has mostly proved harder than  KEYNESIAN  policymakers expected, and it has become unfashionable. However, the use of automatic stabilisers remains widespread. For instance, social handouts from the state usually increase during tough times, and taxes increase ( FISCAL DRAG ), boosting government revenue, when the economy is growing. ']\n",

In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher championed supply-side policies as they attacked  KEYNESIAN  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t DEMAND  management. Pumping up demand without making markets work better would simply lead to higher  INFLATION ; economic growth would increase only when markets were able to operate more freely. Thus they pursued policies of  DEREGULATION ,  LIBERALISATION  and  PRIVATISATION  and encouraged  FREE TRADE . To reduce  UNEMPLOYMENT , they tried to increase the  EFFICIENCY  of the jobs market by cutting the rate of  INCOME TAX  and attacking legal  and other impediments to  LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY . The results of these programmes are much debated. In particular, the belief, apparently supported by the  LAFFER CURVE , that cutting tax rates would increase tax revenue did not always stand up well to real-world testing. Even so, it is now recognised that supply-side reforms are a crucial element in an effective economic policy. ']\n",
      "['S', 'Shares', '\\n     Financial  SECURITIES , each granting part ownership of a company. In return for risking their  CAPITAL  by giving it to the company’s management to develop the business, shareholders get the right to a slice of whatever is left of the firm’s revenue after it has met all its other obligations. This money is paid as a  DIVIDEND , although most companies retain some of their residual revenue for  INVESTMENT  purposes. Shareholders have voting rights, including the right to vote in the election of the company’s board of directors. Shares are also known as equities. They can be traded in the public  FINANCIAL MARKETS  or held as  PRIVATE EQUITY . ']\n",

Selling reserves decreases the supply of the domestic currency; buying reserves increases the domestic money supply. Governments or central banks can sterilise (that is, cancel out) this effect of foreign exchange intervention on the money supply by buying or selling an equivalent amount of  SECURITIES . For example, if the  GOVERNMENT  increases reserves by buying foreign currency the domestic money supply will increase, unless it sells securities such as  TREASURY BILLS  to mop up the extra  DEMAND .

Eight years later he made his name by publishing the  THEORY OF MORAL SENTIMENTS . His 1776 book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, is the bible of  CLASSICAL ECONOMICS . He emphasised the role of specialisation (the  DIVISION OF LABOUR ),  TECHNICAL PROGRESS  and CAPITAL INVESTMENT as the main engines of economic  GROWTH .

Second-best theory, set out in 1956 by Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster (1924-99), looks at what happens when the assumptions of an economic model are not fully met. They found that in situations where not all the conditions are met, the second-best situation - that is, meeting as many of the other conditions as possible - may not result in the  OPTIMUM  solution. Indeed, reckoned Lipsey and Lancaster, in general, when one optimal equilibrium condition is not satisfied all of the other equilibrium conditions will change.\\n Potentially, the second-best equilibrium may be worse than a new equilibrium brought about by  GOVERNMENT  intervention, either to restore equilibrium to the market that is in  DISEQUILIBRIUM , or to move the other markets away from their second-best conditions.\\n Economists have seized on this insight to justify all sorts of interventions in the economy, ranging from taxing certain goods and subsidising others to restricting  FREE TRADE . Whenever there is  MARKET FAILURE , second-best theory says it is always possible to design a government policy that would increase economic  WELFARE . Alas, the history of government intervention suggests that although the second best may be improved on in theory, in practice second best is often least worst. ']\n",

This blended market  CAPITALISM , strong  LABOUR  protection and union influence, and a generous  WELFARE  state. The phrase has also been used to describe attempts to make capitalism more caring, and to the use of market mechanisms to increase the  EFFICIENCY  of the social functions of the state, such as the education system or prisons. More broadly, it refers to the study of the different social institutions underpinning every market economy. ']\n",

      "['S', 'Structural unemployment', '\\n     The hardest sort of  UNEMPLOYMENT  to cure because it is caused by the structure of an economy rather than by changes in the economic cycle. Contrast with cyclical unemployment, which can, in theory  if not always in practice, be cut without sparking  INFLATION  by stimulating faster economic  GROWTH . Structural unemployment can be reduced only by changing the economic structures causing it, for instance, by removing rules that limit  LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY . ']\n",

CLASSICAL ECONOMICS  and  NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS  assume that individuals,  FIRMS  and  GOVERNMENTS  try to achieve the  OPTIMUM , best possible outcome from their decisions. Satisficing assumes they decide for each goal a level of achievement that would be good enough and try to find a way to achieve all of these sub-optimal goals at once. This approach to decision making is commonplace in behavioural economics. It can be regarded as a realist's theory of how decisions are taken.

      "['S', 'Systemic risk', '\\n     The  RISK  of damage being done to the health of the  FINANCIAL SYSTEM  as a whole. A constant concern of  BANK  regulators is that the collapse of a single bank could bring down the entire financial system. This is why regulators often organise a rescue when a bank gets into financial difficulties. However, the expectation of such a rescue may create a  MORAL HAZARD , encouraging banks to behave in ways that increase systemic risk. Another concern of regulators is that the \\xad RISK MANAGEMENT  methods used by banks are so similar that they may increase systemic risk by creating a tendency for crowd behaviour. In particular, problems in one market may cause banks in general to liquidate positions in other markets, causing a vicious cycle of  LIQUIDITY  being withdrawn from the financial system as everybody rushes for the emergency exit at once.

      "['S', 'Secondary market', '\\n     A market in second-hand  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS .  BONDS  and  SHARES  are first sold in the primary market, for instance, through an initial public offering. After that, their new owners often sell them in the secondary market. The existence of liquid secondary markets can encourage people to buy in the primary market, as they know they are likely to be able to sell easily should they wish. ']\n",

How these different interests should be catered for, and what to do when they conflict, is much debated. In particular, there is growing disagreement between those who argue that companies should be run primarily in the interests of their shareholders, in order to maximise  shareholder value , and those who argue that the wishes of shareholders should sometimes be traded off against those of other stakeholders.

      "['S', 'Substitution effect', '\\n     When the  PRICE  of petrol falls people buy more of it. There are two reasons.\\n The  INCOME EFFECT : cheaper petrol means that real purchasing power rises, so consumers have more to spend on everything, including petrol.\\n The substitution effect: petrol has become cheaper relative to everything else, so people switch some of their  CONSUMPTION  out of goods that are now relatively more expensive and buy more petrol instead.

      "['S', 'Securitisation', '\\n     Turning a future cashflow into tradable,  BOND -like  SECURITIES . Creating such ASSET-backed securities became a lucrative business for financial  FIRMS  during the 1990s, as they invented new securities based on cashflow ranging from future mortgage and credit-card payments to  BANK  loans, movie revenue and even the royalties on songs by David Bowie (so-called Bowie-bonds). Securitisation has many benefits, at least in\\xadtheory. Issuers gain instant access to  MONEY  for which they would otherwise have to wait months or years, and they can shed some of the  RISK  that their expected revenue will not materialise. By selling securitised loans, investment banks are able to finance their customers without tying up large amounts of  CAPITAL . Investors can hold a new sort of asset, less risky than unsecured bonds, giving them the risk-reducing benefit of  DIVERSIFICATION . But there are dangers. The future cashflow underlying the securities may flow earlier or later than promised, or not at all. ']\n",

Ultimately, savings are the source of  INVESTMENT  in an economy, although domestic savings may be supplemented by  CAPITAL  from foreign savers or themselves be invested abroad.\\n In an economic sense, savings include purchases of  SHARES  or other financial  SECURITIES . However, many official measures of a country's savings ratio--total savings expressed as a percentage of total income--leave out such financial transactions. At times when the demand for financial securities is unusually high, this can give a misleading impression of how much saving is taking place.\\n How much individuals save varies significantly among different age groups (see  LIFE-CYCLE HYPOTHESIS ) and nationalities. Everywhere, people of all ages save more as their income rises. The supply of savings rises when  INTEREST  rates rise; a rise in interest rates causes  DEMAND  for funds to invest to fall; a rise in demand for investment funds may cause interest rates, and thus the  COST OF CAPITAL , to rise. The level of savings is also influenced by changes in wealth (see  WEALTH EFFECT ) and by  TAXATION  policies. \"]\n",
      "['S', 'Scalability', '\\n     The ease with which the  SUPPLY  of an economic product or process can be expanded to meet increased  DEMAND . Recent technological advances have led some economists to talk about the growing importance of instant scalability. For example, once a piece of software has been written it can be made available in an instant over the Internet to unlimited numbers of users for almost no cost. This potentially allows a new product to enter and win market share far more quickly than ever before, intensifying  COMPETITION  and perhaps accelerating the process of creative destruction (see  SCHUMPETER ). ']\n",
      "['S', 'Speculation', '\\n     An attitude to  INVESTMENT  that is often criticised. According to critics, speculation involves buying or selling a financial  ASSET  with the aim of making a quick  PROFIT . This is contrasted with long-term investment, in which an asset is retained despite short-term fluctuations in its value. Speculators actually play a valuable role in  FINANCIAL MARKETS  as their appetite for frequent buying and selling provides  LIQUIDITY  to the markets. This benefits longer-term investors, too, as it enables them to get a good  PRICE  when they do eventually sell. ']\n",

After the bursting of the stockmarket  bubble  and the failure of  Enron  at the start of the 2000s, much like during the 1980s, accusations of short-termism were often made against the stockmarket-focused  CAPITALISM  of the United States and the UK. During the bubble, it was claimed, investors had become too focused on short-term  profits  and changes in  share  prices, and failed to probe deeply enough into long-term performance. As a result, managers did things that made their profits look as good as possible in the short run, often to the detriment of their company's long-term health. Indeed, many  firms  engaged in misleading and even fraudulent accounting practices to inflate short-term profits. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the complaint took a slightly different form, and was arguably less convincing, namely that short-termism caused lower levels of  INVESTMENT  by businesses than in countries where the stockmarket was less important, such as Germany and Japan. \"]\n",
      "['S', 'Sticky prices', \"\\n     Petrol-pump  PRICES  do not change every time the oil price changes, and holiday prices and standard hotel rates are fixed for months. Sticky prices are slow to change in response to changes in  SUPPLY  or  DEMAND . As a result there is, at least temporarily,  DISEQUILIBRIUM  in the market. The causes of stickiness include  MENU COSTS , inadequate information, consumers' dislike of frequent price changes and long-term contracts with fixed prices. Prices change only when the cost of leaving them unchanged exceeds the expense of adjusting them. In  FINANCIAL MARKETS , prices move all the time because the cost of quoting the wrong price can be huge. In other industries, the penalty may be much less severe. Small disequilibria in, say, the pricing of hotel rooms will not make much difference. So hotel prices are often sticky. \"]\n",

Certainly, even if the result of number crunching is statistically significant, it does not actually mean it is true. But it does mean it is much more likely to be true than false. Statistical significance means that the  PROBABILITY  of getting that result by chance is low. The most commonly used measure of statistical significance is that there must be a 95% chance that the result is right and only a 1 in 20 chance of the result occurring randomly. ']\n",
      "['S', 'Sequencing', '\\n     Shorthand for implementing economic reforms in the right order. In recent years, this has become a hot topic in  development economics . Some economists argue that introducing the right policies alone is not enough to revive a malfunctioning economy; reforms must be implemented in the right sequence. Thus they debate when in the reform process there should be, say,  privatisation  of state enterprises, and in which order, or the lifting of  capital controls  or other trade barriers. Other economists dispute whether there is a right sequence. ']\n",

      "['S', 'Search costs', '\\n     The cost of finding what you want. The economic cost of buying something is not simply the  PRICE  you pay. Finding what you want and ensuring that it is competitively priced can be expensive, be it the financial cost of physically getting to a marketplace or the  OPPORTUNITY COST  of time spent fact-finding. Search costs mean that people often take decisions without all the relevant  INFORMATION , which can result in inefficiency. Technological changes such as the internet may sharply reduce search costs, and thus lead to more efficient decision making. ']\n",

Shadow prices can be calculated for those goods and  SERVICES  that do not have a market price, perhaps because they are set by  GOVERNMENT .

Often the biggest problem facing sellers is how to convince buyers that what they are selling is as good as they say it is. This problem arises in situations where the qualities of the thing being sold cannot be observed easily by buyers, who thus fear that sellers may be conning them. In such situations, an answer may be for sellers to do something that shows they mean what they say about quality. This something is what economists call signalling.\\n Going to a leading university might be worth far more for what it signals to prospective employers about your abilities than for what you learn as a student. Likewise, the fact that a firm is willing to spend a lot of  MONEY  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ADVERTISING  its product may say far more about what it thinks of the product than any information included in the actual ad. To be useful, signals must impose more costs on those who use them to send false messages than any gains to be had from lying. ']\n",
      "['S', 'Social capital', '\\n     The amount of community spirit or  trust  that an economy has gluing it together. The more social capital there is, the more productive the economy will be. Yet, curiously, one of the best-known books to address the role of social capital, \"Bowling Alone\", by Robert Putnam of Harvard University, pointed out that Americans were far less likely to be members of community organisations, clubs or associations in the 1990s than they were in the 1950s. He illustrated his thesis by charting the decline of bowling leagues. Yet the American economy has gone from strength to strength. This has led some economists to question whether social capital is really as important as the theory suggests, and others to argue that membership of bowling leagues and other community organisations is simply not a good indicator of the amount of social capital in a country.

Supply is the amount of a good or service available at any particular  PRICE . The law of supply is that, other things remaining the same, the quantity supplied will increase as the price increases. The actual amount supplied will be determined, ultimately, by what the market price is, which depends on the amount demanded as well as what suppliers are willing to produce. What suppliers are willing to supply depends on several things:\\n the cost of the  FACTORS OF PRODUCTION ;\\n technology;\\n the price of other goods and  SERVICES  (which, if high enough, might tempt the supplier to switch production to those products); and\\n the ability of the supplier accurately to forecast demand and plan production to make the most of the opportunity.

When there is a lack of trust, people may have to spend heavily on monitoring others' behaviour to ensure they do what they say they will do. This cost may be so high that it is not worth going ahead with a business deal. When trust is absent, people may be less flexible in their dealings with each other. Countries can overcome some of the problems of a lack of trust by passing laws requiring good behaviour, but only to the extent that people trust that the laws will be enforced.

Many regulators, private lenders, politicians and economists reckoned that the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s would not have been so severe, or even have happened, had Asian governments,  BANKS  and other companies made available more and better data about their financial condition. Likewise, the collapse of  Enron  provoked demands for greater transparency, to help improve corporate governance in the United States and other industrialised countries.

      "['T', 'Trade area', \"\\n     In a globalising economy, it is perhaps surprising that countries increasingly trade with their nearest neighbours. One explanation is geography: as countries have lowered their  TARIFF  barriers, the relatively greater importance of transport costs makes proximity matter more. According to  NEW TRADE THEORY , this also produces gains from  ECONOMIES OF SCALE . But another reason for the fast growth in trade among nearby countries may be less benign. The proliferation of regional trade agreements may be causing neighbours to trade with each other when it would be more efficient for them to export to and import from afar.\\n In the past 50 years more than 150 regional trade agreements have been notified to the  GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE  (GATT) or the  WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION  (WTO), most of which are still in force. Roughly half of these, including some revisions of previous deals, have been set up since 1990. The best-known are the  EUROPEAN UNION , the North American Free-Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and Mercosur in South America. There are dozens of other examples.\\n Economists have generally been unenthusiastic about regionalism, for two reasons. First, they worry that preferential tariffs will cause trade to flow in inefficient ways, a process known as trade diversion. In a perfect world, trade patterns should be determined by  COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE : the comparative cost of making different goods yourself as opposed to buying them from various countries. If the United States imports Mexican televisions merely because the Mexican goods are tariff-free, even if Malaysia has a comparative advantage in television manufacturing, the main benefit of trade will be lost.\\n The second concern is that regionalism will impede efforts to liberalise trade throughout the world. One prominent critic, Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University in New York, has famously said that regional trade areas are 'stumbling blocks' rather than 'building blocks' in the freeing of global trade. There is no clear-cut theoretical answer to the question of whether regional trade agreements are good or bad, and  the empirical findings are hotly disputed. In general, though, it seems likely that it is better to have regional groups that are open to the rest of the world than groups that are closed. \"]\n",

Economists usually favour  COMPETITION  in any form. But some say that tax competition is often a beggar-thy-neighbour policy, which can reduce another country\\'s  TAX BASE , or force it to change its mix of taxes, or stop it taxing in the way it would like.\\n Economists who favour tax competition often cite a 1956 article by Charles Tiebout (1924-68) entitled \"A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures\". In it he argued that, faced with a choice of different combinations of tax and government  SERVICES , taxpayers will choose to locate where they get closest to the mixture they want. Variations in tax rates among different countries are good, because they give taxpayers more choice and thus more chance of being satisfied. This also puts pressure on governments to be efficient. Thus measures to harmonise taxes are a bad idea.\\n There is at least one big caveat to this theory. Tiebout assumed, crucially, that taxpayers are highly mobile and able to move to wherever their preferred combination of taxes and benefits is on offer. But many taxpayers, including the great majority of workers, are not able to move easily. Tax competition may make it harder to redistribute from rich to poor through the tax system by allowing the rich to move to where taxes are not redistributive. ']\n",

If Q is greater than 1, then it should pay the firm to expand, as the  PROFIT  it should expect to make from its assets (reflected in the share  PRICE ) exceeds the cost of the assets. If Q is less than 1, the firm would be better off selling its assets, which are worth more than shareholders currently expect the firm to earn in profit by retaining them.\\n Tobin also gave his name to the 'Tobin tax', a (so far unimplemented) proposal to reduce speculative cross-border flows of  CAPITAL  by levying a small tax on foreign exchange transactions. \"]\n",

For instance, by charging low transfer prices from a unit based in a high-tax country that is selling to a unit in a low-tax country, a firm can record a low  PROFIT  in the first country and a high profit in the second. In theory, however, transfer prices are supposed to be set according to the arm's-length principle: that they should be the same as would be charged if the sale was to a business unconnected in any way to the selling firm. But when there is no genuinely independent market with which to compare transfer prices, what an arm's length price would be can be a matter of great debate and an opportunity for firms that want to lower their tax bill. \"]\n",

      "['T', 'Taxation', \"\\n     Prostitution may be the oldest profession, but tax collection was surely not far behind. In its early days, taxation did not always involve handing over money. The ancient Chinese paid with pressed tea, and Jivara tribesmen in Brazil stumped up shrunken heads. As the  PRICE  of their citizenship, ancient Greeks and Romans could be called on to serve as soldiers and had to supply their own weapons. The origins of modern taxation can be traced to wealthy subjects paying money to their king in lieu of military service.\\n The other early source of tax revenue was trade, with tolls and customs duties being collected from travelling merchants. The big advantage of these taxes was that they fell mostly on visitors rather than residents.\\n INCOME TAX , the biggest source of  GOVERNMENT  funds today in most countries, is a comparatively recent invention, probably because the notion of annual  INCOME  is itself a modern concept. Governments preferred to tax things that were easy to measure and on which it was thus easy to calculate the liability. This is why early taxes concentrated on tangible items such as  LAND  and property, physical goods, commodities and ships, as well as things such as the number of windows or fireplaces in a building.\\n In the 20th century, particularly the second half, governments around the world took a growing share of their country's  NATIONAL INCOME  in tax, mainly to pay for increasingly more expensive  defence efforts and for a modern  WELFARE  state.  INDIRECT TAXATION  on  CONSUMPTION , such as VALUE-ADDED tax, has become increasingly important as  DIRECT TAXATION  on income and wealth has become increasingly unpopular.\\n But big differences among countries remain. One is the overall level of tax. For example, in United States tax revenue amounts to around one-third of its  GDP , whereas in Sweden it is closer to half. Others are the preferred methods of collecting it (direct versus indirect), the rates at which it is levied and the definition of the  TAX BASE  to which these rates are applied. Countries have different attitudes to  PROGRESSIVE  and  REGRESSIVE TAXATION . There are also big differences in the way responsibility for taxation is divided among different levels of government.\\n Arguably, any tax is a bad tax. But  PUBLIC GOODS  and other government activities have to be paid for somehow, and economists often have strong views on which methods of taxation are more or less efficient. Most economists agree that the best tax is one that has as little impact as possible on people's decisions about whether to undertake a productive economic activity. High rates of tax on  LABOUR  may discouragepeople from working, and so result in lower tax revenue than there would be if the tax rate were lower, an idea captured in the  LAFFER CURVE . Certainly, the  MARGINAL  rate of tax may have a bigger effect on incentives than the overall  TAX BURDEN .\\n LAND TAX  is regarded as the most efficient by some economists and tax on expenditure by others, as it does all the taking after the wealth creation is done.\\n Some economists favour a neutral tax system that does not influence the sorts of economic activities that take place. Others favour using tax, and tax breaks, to guide economic activity in ways they favour, such as to minimise pollution and to increase the attractiveness of employing people rather than  CAPITAL . Some economists argue that the tax system should be characterised by both  HORIZONTAL EQUITY  and  VERTICAL EQUITY , because this is fair, and because when the tax system is fair people may find it harder to justify  TAX AVOIDANCE  and  TAX EVASION . However, who ultimately pays (the  TAX INCIDENCE ) may be different from who is initially charged, if that person can pass it on, say by adding the tax to the price he charges for his  OUTPUT . Taxes on companies, for example, are always paid in the end by humans, be they workers, customers or shareholders. \"]\n",

      "['U', 'Utility', '\\n     Economist-speak for a good thing; a measure of satisfaction. (See also  WELFARE .) Underlying most economic theory is the assumption that people do things because doing so gives them utility. People want as much utility as they can get. However, the more they have, the less difference an additional unit of utility will make - there is diminishing  MARGINAL  utility. Utility is not the same as utilitarianism, a political philosophy based on achieving the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\\n A tricky question is how to measure utility.  MONEY  does not (entirely) capture it. You can get richer without becoming more satisfied. So some economists have tried to calculate broader measures of happiness. They have found that people with jobs are much happier than unemployed people. Low  INFLATION  also makes people happier. Extra  INCOME  increases happiness a bit, but not much. In many countries incomes have risen sharply in recent years, but national surveys of subjective well being have stayed flat. Within countries, comparing people across the income distribution, richer does mean happier, but the effect is not large. Married people are often happier than single people; couples without children happier than couples with; women happier than men; white people happier than black people; well-educated people happier than uneducated people; the self-employed happier than employees; and retired people happier than economically active people. Happiness generally decreases until you are in your 30s, and then starts rising again. Other economists are dismissive of such studies. They argue that people are rational maximisers of their own utility, so, by definition, whatever they do maximises their utility. ']\n",

      "['U', 'Unions', '\\n     In developed countries, at least, trade union membership and influence has declined over the past three decades. Fewer  WAGES  are now set by collective bargaining, and far fewer working days are lost to strikes. Unions, which are in effect a  CARTEL  of workers, probably make  UNEMPLOYMENT  higher than it would be without them, as collective bargaining often pushes wages above the level that would bring LABOUR SUPPLY and  DEMAND  into  EQUILIBRIUM . These higher wages increase supply and reduce demand, with the result that there are more jobless people. Unions thus deepen a conflict between those in the labour market who are insiders, that is, union members, and those who are outsiders, typically non-unionised, poorly paid or jobless people. However, unions can combat the excessive market power of some  FIRMS , particularly when the firms (or a  GOVERNMENT ) dominate a particular job market. They can support workers who are badly treated by management. They may sometimes provide an efficient, and thus valuable, channel for communication between workers and managers, particularly in countries such as Germany, where conflict between management and unions is viewed as unhealthy.

      "['U', 'Unemployment', '\\n     The number of people of working age without a job is usually expressed as an unemployment rate, a percentage of the workforce. This rate generally rises and falls in step with the  BUSINESS CYCLE --cyclical unemployment. But some joblessness is not caused by the cycle, being  STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT . There are also  VOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT  and involuntary unemployment. Some people who are not in work have no interest in getting a job and probably should not be regarded as part of the workforce. Others choose to be out of work briefly while they look for, or are waiting to start, a new job. This is known as  FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT . In the 1950s, the  PHILLIPS CURVE  seemed to show that policymakers could reduce unemployment by having higher  INFLATION . Economists now say there is a  NAIRU  (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). In most markets,  PRICES  change to keep  SUPPLY  and  DEMAND  in  EQUILIBRIUM ; in the  LABOUR  market, wages are often sticky, being slow to fall when demand declines or supply increases. In these situations, unemployment often increases. One way to tackle this may be to boost demand. Another is to increase  LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY . ']\n",

For many centuries, the Catholic Church regarded as sinful the charging of any interest by lenders and it was not allowed in Catholic countries, although Jews were exempted, provided they did not charge excessive rates. According to Pope Benedict XIV, in 1745, interest should be regarded as a sin because \"the creditor desires more than he has given\".\\n In most modern economies, interest is recognised as a crucial part of the economic system, a reward to the lender for the  RISK  taken in making a loan. Even so, most developed countries have some form of usury law imposing limits on how high interest charges can be. These aim to protect borrowers from being exploited by unscrupulous loan sharks.

Slightly more talented window cleaners will make only a small difference to the transparency of their customers' windows, but in the markets for selling  BONDS  that slight edge can mean everything. Rewards at the top are therefore disproportionately high, and rewards below the top are disproportionately low.

A cut in interest rates has the opposite effect. Economists disagree on the wealth  ELASTICITY  of  CONSUMPTION : how much consumer spending would rise if wealth increased by, say, 1%. Different consumers may have different wealth elasticity. If most of the increase in wealth goes to poorer people this may have a different wealth effect than if most of it went to people who are already wealthy. The source of the wealth increase may also matter. If  SHARE  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t PRICES  rise or interest rates fall, consumers may be slow to spend out of their increased wealth if they think the increase may be temporary. However, if they think a sharp rise in share prices is permanent and the stockmarket then tumbles, the result may be that consumption falls by enough to cause a  RECESSION . The wealth effect of rising  HOUSE PRICES  is particularly uncertain. ']\n",
      "['W', 'Wages', \"\\n     The  PRICE  of  LABOUR . In theory, wages ought to change so that the  SUPPLY  and  DEMAND  in the labour market are always in  EQUILIBRIUM . In practice, wages are often sticky, especially in a downward direction: when demand for labour falls, wages do not fall. In this situation, the fall in demand results in higher involuntary  UNEMPLOYMENT . Trade  UNIONS  may use collective bargaining to keep wages above the market-clearing rate. Furthermore, many governments impose a  MINIMUM WAGE  that employers must pay.\\n FIRMS  may choose to pay above the equilibrium wage to increase the  PRODUCTIVITY  of workers. Such so-called  EFFICIENCY WAGES  may make workers less likely to join another firm, so cutting the employer's hiring and training costs. They may encourage workers to do a better job. They may also attract a higher quality of worker than wages at the market-clearing rate; better workers may have a higher  RESERVATION WAGE  (the lowest wage for which they are willing to work) than the market-clearing equilibrium.\\n In recent years, employers have tried to reduce wage stickiness by increasing the proportion of pay that is linked to the performance of their firm. Thus if falling demand reduces the employer's  PROFIT  the pay of its employees falls automatically, so it does not have to lay off as many workers as it otherwise would. Performance-related wages can also reduce  AGENCY COSTS  by giving hired hands a stronger incentive to do a good job. \"]\n",
      "['W', 'Weightless economy', '\\n     At the start of the 21st century, the total  OUTPUT  of the American economy weighed roughly the same as it did 100 years earlier. Yet the value of that output, in  REAL TERMS , was 20 times greater. Output is increasingly weightless, produced from  INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL  rather than physical materials. Production has shifted from steel, heavy copper wire and vacuum tubes to microprocessors, fine fibre-optic cables and transistors.  SERVICES  have increased their share of  GDP . This weightless or dematerialised economy, most economists agree, is not just lighter but also more efficient. ']\n",
      "['W', 'Wealth tax', \"\\n     In most countries, the majority of wealth is concentrated in a fairly small number of hands. This makes a wealth tax appealing to politicians, as it should allow substantial amounts of revenue to be raised from comparatively few people, allowing the  TAX BURDEN  on the majority of the  POPULATION  to be kept down. It also appeals because it promotes meritocracy by making it harder to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth. A wealth tax reduces the disparities in wealth rather than  INCOME  that are the biggest determinant of how the scales are weighted for succeeding generations. What could be better than a tax that produces lots of money for the  GOVERNMENT  and strikes most voters as being extremely fair?\\n Alas, as critics point out, wealth taxes may cause inefficiency by discouraging wealth-creating economic activities. Moreover, the revenue collected may prove disappointing. The wealthiest people are often the most skilled at  TAX AVOIDANCE , not least because they can afford good tax accountants. Despite the enormous concentration of wealth in a small part of the population, on  AVERAGE  across the  OECD  wealth taxes account for less than 2% of total tax revenue.\\n A wealth tax can achieve  HORIZONTAL EQUITY  and  VERTICAL EQUITY  (so that people of similar means pay the same and those with more pay more) in ways that  INCOME TAX  cannot. For instance, neither a poor person nor a rich person with no income would pay income tax, and only the rich person would pay the wealth tax.\\n Wealth taxes come in two main forms.  CAPITAL  transfer taxes are levied when wealth changes hands, either at death (inheritance tax) or through donation (gift tax). Annual wealth taxes are levied each year as a fraction of the taxpayer's net worth. Some people regard  CAPITAL GAINS  tax as a wealth tax, but, strictly speaking, it is a tax on the income earned on capital, rather than a wealth tax on the capital itself. \"]\n",
      "['W', 'Wage drift', '\\n     The difference between basic pay and total earnings. Wage drift consists of things such as overtime payments, bonuses,  PROFIT  share and performance-related pay. It usually increases during periods of strong  GROWTH  and declines during an economic downturn. ']\n",
      "['X', 'X-efficiency', \"\\n     Producing  OUTPUT  at the minimum possible cost. This is not enough to ensure the best sort of economic  EFFICIENCY , which maximises society's total  CONSUMER  plus  PRODUCER SURPLUS , because the quantity of output produced may not be ideal. For instance, a  MONOPOLY  can be an X-efficient producer, but in order to maximise its  PROFIT  it may produce a different quantity of output than there would be in a surplus-maximising market with  PERFECT COMPETITION . \"]\n",
      "['Y', 'Yield gap', '\\n     A way of comparing the performance of  BONDS  and  SHARES . The gap is defined as the  AVERAGE  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t YIELD  on equities minus the average yield on  bonds. Because shares are usually riskier investments than bonds, you might expect them to have a higher yield. In practice, the yield gap is often negative, with bonds yielding more than equities. This is not because investors regard equities as safer than bonds (see  EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ). Rather, it is that they expect most of the benefit from buying shares to come from an increase in their  PRICE  ( CAPITAL  appreciation) rather than from  DIVIDEND  payments. Bond investors usually expect more of their gains to come from coupon payments. They also worry that  INFLATION  will erode the  REAL VALUE  of future coupons, making them value current payments more highly than those due in years to come. Moreover, the usefulness of the dividend yield as a guide to the performance of shares has declined since the early 1990s, as increasingly companies have chosen to return cash to shareholders by buying back their own shares rather than paying out bigger dividends. ']\n",
      "['Y', 'Yield curve', '\\n     Shorthand for comparisons of the  INTEREST RATE  on  GOVERNMENT  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t BONDS  of different maturity. If investors think it is riskier to buy a bond with 15 years until it matures than a bond with five years of life, they will demand a higher interest rate ( YIELD ) on the longer-dated bond. If so, the yield curve will slope upwards from left (the shorter maturities) to right. It is normal for the yield curve to be positive (upward sloping, left to right) simply because investors normally demand compensation for the added  RISK  of holding longer-term  SECURITIES . Historically, a downward-sloping (or inverted) yield curve has been an indicator of  RECESSION  on the horizon, or, at least, that investors expect the  CENTRAL BANK  to cut short-term interest rates in the near future. A flat yield curve means that investors are indifferent to maturity risk, but this is unusual. When the yield curve as a whole moves higher, it means that investors are more worried that  INFLATION  will rise for the foreseeable future and therefore that higher interest rates will be needed. When the whole curve moves lower, it means that investors have a rosier inflationary outlook.\\n Even if the direction (up or down) of a yield curve is unchanged, useful information can be gleaned from changes in the  SPREADS  between yields on bonds of different maturities and on different sorts of bonds with the same maturity (such as government bonds versus corporate bonds, or thinly traded bonds versus highly liquid bonds). ']\n",
      "['Y', 'Yield', '\\n     The annual income from a  SECURITY , expressed as a percentage of the current market  PRICE  of the security. The yield on a  SHARE  is its  DIVIDEND  divided by its price. A  BOND  yield is also known as its  INTEREST RATE : the annual coupon divided by the market price. ']\n",
      "['Z', 'Zero-sum game', '\\n     When the gains made by winners in an economic transaction equal the losses suffered by the losers. It is identified as a special case in  GAME THEORY . Most economic transactions are in some sense positive-sum games. But in popular discussion of economic issues, there are often examples of a mistaken zero-sum mentality, such as “ PROFIT  comes at the expense of  WAGES ”, “higher  PRODUCTIVITY  means fewer jobs”, and “ IMPORTS  mean fewer jobs here”.
